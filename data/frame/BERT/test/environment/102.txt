fracking has become an internationally recognized threat to planetary health and safety . in 2012 , the united nations environment programme ( unep ) issued a " global alert " on fracking . according to unep , hydraulic fracking may result in " unavoidable environmental impacts , " even if unconventional gas is extracted properly . in the united states , the fracked gas and oil industry has polluted the water supplies of heavily drilled communities , produced massive volumes of toxic waste , caused earthquakes and imperiled vital aquifers from poorly constructed gas wells .
