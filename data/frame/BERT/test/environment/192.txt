equally promising are nano - formulated pesticides and fertilisers which could , paradoxically , reduce pollution . nano - sized particles have a much larger surface area , per weight equivalent , than conventional materials , making then more reactive . " you need less , and a smaller amount [ of agrochemical ] can cover a much larger area " , chaudhry says . similarly , nano - sized additive in animal feed could improve the absorption of mineral supplements such as copper and zinc , meaning less would be excreted to pollute land and water .
