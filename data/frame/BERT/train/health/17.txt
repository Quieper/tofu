I didn't feel good at all and In addition to the bellyaches I also had many headaches and my whole body felt bad. But worst of all, my menstrual cycle became totally irregular. Which I think shouldn't be happening while doing a detox program?! I mean how can a tea to influence your menstrual cycle? This Bootea seems to contain some really weird ingredients and I'm not sure yet if I want to know what I exactly consumed these 14 days.”
