At the Statehouse: An amendment was written into SB 535 which will grandfather in Henry and Montgomery county town safety ordinances adopted prior to January 2018. The ordinances will prevent wind turbines from being built within four miles of the town. There are 12 counties in Indiana with no zoning and no protection from wind turbines. Special thanks to all Indiana Wind Watch supporters who reached out to legislators on this issue!
