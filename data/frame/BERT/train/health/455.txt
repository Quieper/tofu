    I have been accused, in part, for fueling fear by raising the alarm that imminent forced vaccination may be coming. However, every indicator points to this likelihood. Major governments around the world have just imposed national states of emergency protocols, which legally entitles them to impose forced vaccination on the entire population. This crisis is driven especially by psychological momentum, fomented through a media blitz of ominous “facts and figures” which characterize the global threat posed by the Coronavirus as unprecedented, one which demands complete societal cooperation, otherwise millions of people will die. At no time have the media provided a balance report on the data, the fact that, as of March 16th, 56,003 of the 67,799 Corona cases in Hubei, China, the original epicenter of the outbreak have FULLY recovered. What this means is, the virus may have already peaked, stabilized, and that many of the prognostications on it, have been exaggerated.
