I don’t buy it. If Monday’s demonstration showed us anything at all, it’s that “real” meat won’t necessarily taste like a piece of muscle from a cow. Mark Post’s proof of concept started yellow-white, so he colored it with beet juice, caramel and saffron. If it’s to be sold at Burger King or Shake Shack, more fixes will be necessary. In his 2011 review of in vitro meat for The New Yorker, Michael Specter noted that “taste and texture—fats and salt and varying amounts of protein—can be engineered into lab-grown meat with relative ease.” The website for the London patty project—which calls it “cultured beef,” as if describing artisanal sauerkraut—explains that “accepted food technology methods will be/have been used to adapt the beef’s taste and texture so that it is virtually identical to farmed beef.”
