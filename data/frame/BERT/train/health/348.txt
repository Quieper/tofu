On 5/6/19, Jasper County Commissioners voted to approve a stricter wind ordinance that affords more protection for their citizens. Setbacks have been changed to 1,760 feet from a property line and 2,400 feet from a property line. There is a no wind turbine zone north of 1200 S. (which is much of the county). Jasper County citizens are encouraged to remain vigilant.
