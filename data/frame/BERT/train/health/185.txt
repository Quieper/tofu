By modifying the epigenome, scientists were able to control a gene's behaviour without modifying any DNA directly; gene modification rather than gene editing. In trials on mice, the scientists reversed symptoms of kidney disease, Type 1 diabetes, and a form of muscular dystrophy. It also has potential for eradicating Alzheimer's.
