The approach of having multi-sectoral, multi-author teams is aimed ensuring that a broad balance of interest is represented. Each strategic issue identified will be addressed by the teams of authors, who are recognised experts and knowledgeable persons.Â  The work of the multi-author teams will in turn be reviewed by independent experts.
