There is a new, untested, alternative method proposed by geothermal proponents in Canada – but the problem is that this form is untested.  There is no large scale geothermal in operation in Canada at present and no pilot project of this alternative method. Therefore, it is not reasonable to set a nation’s energy generation and employment policy based on something that does not exist, and that requires a process that the Green Party election platform strictly forbids, that being fracking.
