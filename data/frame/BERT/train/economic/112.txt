This goes along with being a renewable energy. As long as our planet is here, we are going to have wind. There are also many places to harvest the wind. For example, the United States has an abundance of land that has the correct wind density to produce electricity. To be considered a "Good Wind Resource" you must have average annual wind speed of 13mph.
