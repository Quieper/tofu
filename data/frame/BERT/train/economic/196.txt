The above-ground heat pump is relatively inexpensive, with underground installation of ground loops (piping) accounting for most of the systemâ€™s cost. Heat pumps can support space heating and cooling needs in almost any part of the country, and they can also be used for domestic hot water applications. Increasing the capacity of the piping loops can scale this technology for larger buildings or locations where space heating and cooling, as well as water heating, may be needed for most of the year.
