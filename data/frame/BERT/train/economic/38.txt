One possible reason for solar’s higher price tag is a variety of “soft costs” included in the production of solar energy. These refer to the costs of installing and maintaining solar that don’t have to deal with the actual hardware. For instance, soft costs can include permit fees, sales tax, customer acquisition and supply chain expenses. The cost for solar panels themselves has dropped by 60 percent since 2010 – but the costs for just customer acquisition actually grew by 10 percent in 2016.
