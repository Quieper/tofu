Homes, companies, farms and governments are some entities that use photocells to generate power. You may have seen solar panels, composed of multiple photocells, anchored to the roofs of local homes and businesses. Ten or twenty solar panels often power an average home where around forty cells make up a module. Some panels are on tracking devices that follow the sun, while others are stationary and face south. People in places powered by solar panels are free to use the electricity any way they like. You can purchase special batteries that store the energy that solar panels produce. These come in handy when the sun goes down and you need electricity.
