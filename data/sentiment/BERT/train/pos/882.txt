but without this absolutely necessary switch to wind energy , our coastline are going to drastically change , and not for the better , as rising sea levels flood thousands of miles of coast around the world . it would be much better to have wind turbines in the viewing area than to watch our coastline disappear entirely because we did nothing when we had the chance . wind power gives us the chance to move away from fossil fuels . and wind can clearly take care of our energy needs alone . now just imagine if we did this and combined it with other forms of renewable energy . we would never have to worry about energy again , and our planet would be healthier , too . it is a win - win .
