the electric power grid of the future is likely to be profoundly different than that of today . it is expected to see high levels of variable wind and solar power . maintaining a functional , efficient and reliable grid will require such power providers to be predictable , controllable , and able to provide , not just power , but essential and stabilizing grid services . the path to the future requires integrated system research at the intersections of atmospheric physics , wind turbine dynamics , plant control , and grid operation .
