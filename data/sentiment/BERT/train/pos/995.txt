the global area sown to genetically modified ( gm ) varieties of leading commercial crops ( soybean , maize , canola , and cotton ) has expanded over 100 - fold over two decades . thirty countries are producing gm crops and just five countries ( united states , brazil , argentina , canada , and india ) account for almost 90 % of the gm production . only four crops account for 99 % of worldwide gm crop area . almost 100 % of gm crops on the market are genetically engineered with herbicide tolerance ( ht ) , and insect resistance ( ir ) traits . approximately 70 % of cultivated gm crops are ht , and gm ht crops have been credited with facilitating no - tillage and conservation tillage practices that conserve soil moisture and control soil erosion , and that also support carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse gas emissions . crop production and productivity increased significantly during the era of the adoption of gm crops ; some of this increase can be attributed to gm technology and the yield protection traits that it has made possible even if the gm traits implemented to - date are not yield traits per se . gm crops have also been credited with helping to improve farm incomes and reduce pesticide use .
