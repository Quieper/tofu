geothermal has minimal land and freshwater requirements . geothermal plants use 3 . 5 square kilometres ( 1 . 4 sq mi ) per gigawatt of electrical production ( not capacity ) versus 32 square kilometres ( 12 sq mi ) and 12 square kilometres ( 4 . 6 sq mi ) for coal facilities and wind farms respectively . [ 13 ] they use 20 litres ( 5 . 3 us gal ) of freshwater per mwh versus over 1 , 000 litres ( 260 us gal ) per mwh for nuclear , coal , or oil . [ 13 ]
