the edge ( edge - based droplet generation ) chip created by professor karin schroen and phd student sami sahin is technically a thick sieve , they explain . ' the chip is made up of several layers of microchannels . for a modest production volume , we can produce twenty cubic metres of product per hour for oil percentage of up to thirty percent , ' says the phd student . ' and we have demonstrated that it is possible to make oil droplets that are all exactly ten micrometres in size . ' with the edge chip , you can even calibrate the size of the droplets .
