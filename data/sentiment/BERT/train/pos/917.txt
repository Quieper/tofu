some proponents of gm crops have argued that because they increase productivity they facilitate more sustainable farming practices and can lead to " greener " agriculture . mannion and morse ( 2013 ) , for example , argue that gm crops require less energy investment in farming because the reduced application of insecticide lowers energy input levels , thereby reducing the carbon footprint . it has been suggested by other authors that the adoption of gm crops may have the potential to reduce inputs such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides ( bennett , ismael , morse , & shankar , 2004 ; bennett , phipps , strange , & grey , 2004 ) . others note that higher crop yields facilitated by gm crops could offset greenhouse gas emissions at scales similar to those attributed to wind and solar energy ( wise et al . , 2009 ) . greenhouse gas emissions from intensive agriculture are also offset by the conservation of non - farmed lands . while untilled forest soils and savanna , for example , act as carbon stores , farmed land is often a carbon source ( burney , davis , & lobell , 2010 ) .
