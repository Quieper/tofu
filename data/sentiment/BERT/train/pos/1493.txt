the vrm has based their claim of a link between vaccines and autism on a paper published in 1998 in the lancet , a prestigious medical journal , by andrew wakefield . it later emerged that wakefield had received funding from litigants against vaccine manufacturers and that wakefield had not informed colleagues or medical authorities of his conflict of interest . had this been known , publication in the lancet would not have taken place . a 2011 article in the british medical journal concluded that the data in the wakefield study had been falsified . an accompanying editorial in the same journal described wakefield work as an " elaborate fraud " which led to lower vaccination rates , putting hundreds of thousands of children at risk and diverting energy and money away from research into the true cause of autism .
