some describe the success of the anti - vaccine movement as success built on better storytelling . at voices for vaccines , we take that to heart . that is because we know , as parents , that one of the most persuasive means of communication among parents is not always the research paper . it is not the newspaper . sometimes , sadly , it is not even the healthcare provider . instead , it is the story shared between parents . it is how we learn to soothe a fussy baby . it is how we learn which baby bottles work best , what kind of diapers to use , which daycare centers or preschool to try . it is often how we choose our child healthcare provider .
