gm crops do not harm honeybees or monarch butterflies . on the contrary , they may reduce the need for pesticides that do harm them . insects that eat genetically modified crops can , in some cases , start to develop a resistance to the protein that usually kills them . this is something to keep an eye on in the future as some gm technologies that work great today will become less effective as certain insects evolve resistance .
