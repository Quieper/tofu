because of the rapid development of the area in the 1980s , and the technology used , the steam resource has been declining since 1988 . today , owned primarily by the california utility calpine and with a net operating capacity of 725 mw , the geysers facilities still meets nearly 60 percent of the average electrical demand for california north coast region ( from the golden gate bridge north to the oregon border ) [ 6 ] . the plants at the geysers use an evaporative water - cooling process to create a vacuum that pulls the steam through the turbine , producing power more efficiently . but this process loses 60 to 80 percent of the steam to the air , without re - injecting it underground . while the steam pressure may be declining , the rocks underground are still hot . to remedy the situation , various stakeholders partnered to create the santa rosa geysers recharge project , which involves transporting 11 million gallons per day of treated wastewater from neighboring communities through a 40 - mile pipeline and injecting it into the ground to provide more steam . the project came online in 2003 , and in 2008 provided enough additional electricity for approximately 100 , 000 homes [ 7 ] .
