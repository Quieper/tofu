as wind turbines increase in size and height to capture more energy , and as wind power plants with many turbines spread out over greater areas and longer distances , there is a need to understand the dynamics of moving air mass and its interactions with the land and turbines at these heights and scales . major gaps exist in our knowledge of wind flows in complex terrain and varying atmospheric conditions . we need to model these conditions more accurately , so that the operation of large - scale wind power plants can be most productive , cost - effective , and controllable .
