solar energy has a substantially reduced impact on the environment compared to fossil fuels . its greenhouse gas emissions are inconsequential as the technology does not require any fuel combustion . also , although concentrating solar thermal plants ( csp ) are comparatively inefficient in their water usage depending on the type of technology being used , the right technology significantly increases efficiency while photovoltaic ( pv ) solar cells do not require any water when generating electricity .
