it is much like bailing out a boat with a slow leak . when we started bailing , the boat was filled with water . but we have been bailing fast and hard , and now it is almost dry . we could say , " good . the boat is dry now , so we can throw away the bucket and relax . " but the leak has not stopped . before long we would notice a little water seeping in , and soon it might be back up to the same level as when we started .
