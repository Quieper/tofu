today , gene editing is happening not just in the united states , but around the world . in the united states , gene editing is practiced on both plants and animals to improve animal welfare , increase productivity or decrease the amount of inputs . an example of ongoing work on gene editing in animals is in the case of pigs . pigs are susceptible to an infection called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( prrs ) . if even one case of prrs is found in a group of pigs , the entire population must be euthanized to prevent any potential spread . gene editing techniques have managed to produce pigs that are resilient to this disease , marking a significant improvement in animal welfare and preventing great waste .
