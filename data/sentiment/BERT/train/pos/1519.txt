the environmental effects of geothermal development and power generation include the changes in land use associated with exploration and plant construction , noise and sight pollution , the discharge of water and gases , the production of foul odours , and soil subsidence . most of those effects , however , can be mitigated with current technology so that geothermal uses have no more than a minimal impact on the environment . for example , klamath falls , oregon , has approximately 600 geothermal wells for residential space heating . the city has also invested in a district heating system and a downtown snow - melting system , and it provides heating to local businesses . however , none of the systems used to supply and deliver geothermal energy are visible in town .
