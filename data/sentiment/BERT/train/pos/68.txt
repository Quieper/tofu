this was just a proof of concept - a way for post to show that synthetic meat is even possible at all . the london burger had no fat cells whatsoever , so it could not taste that much like carcass beef , but future versions will be marbled in the lab : it is just a matter of refining the technology , and scaling up the meat vats for industrial production . post expects to have a viable alternative for farm - raised cattle on the market in the next 10 to 20 years .
