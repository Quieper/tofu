geothermal energy is best found in areas with high thermal gradient . those gradient occur in regions affected by recent volcanism , in areas located along plate boundaries ( such as along the pacific ring of fire ) , or in areas marked by thin crust ( hot spots ) such as yellowstone national park and the hawaiian islands . geothermal reservoirs associated with those regions must have a heat source , adequate water recharge , a reservoir with adequate permeability or faults that allow fluids to rise close to the surface , and an impermeable caprock to prevent the escape of the heat . in addition , such reservoirs must be economically accessible ( that is , within the range of drills ) .
