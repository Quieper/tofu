cushen et al . ( 2013 ) studied the migration of silver and copper from nanocomposites , used for their anti - microbial properties in food packaging . the authors showed that the percentage of nanofiller in the nanocomposites was one of the most critical parameters driving migration , more so than particle size , temperature or contact time . the authors developed a model to study migration of particles from food packaging . this model was a good predictor of the level of migration of nanosilver and to a lesser extent of nanocopper into food stuff and , when further developed and validated , could potentially be of benefit to industry by reducing the time and costs usually associated with migration studies .
