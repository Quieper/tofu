probably the most widely used set of applications involves the direct use of heated water from the ground without the need for any specialized equipment . all direct - use applications make use of low - temperature geothermal resources , which range between about 50 and 150 ° c ( 122 and 302 ° f ) . such low - temperature geothermal water and steam have been used to warm single buildings , as well as whole districts where numerous buildings are heated from a central supply source . in addition , many swimming pools , balneological ( therapeutic ) facilities at spas , greenhouse , and aquaculture ponds around the world have been heated with geothermal resources . other direct uses of geothermal energy include cooking , industrial applications ( such as drying fruit , vegetables , and timber ) , milk pasteurization , and large - scale snow melting . for many of those activities , hot water is often used directly in the heating system , or it may be used in conjunction with a heat exchanger , which transfers heat when there are problematic minerals and gases such as hydrogen sulfide mixed in with the fluid .
