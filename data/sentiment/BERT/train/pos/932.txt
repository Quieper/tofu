engineered crops can dramatically increase per area crop yields and , in some cases , reduce the use of chemical insecticides . for example , the application of wide - spectrum insecticides declined in many areas growing plants , such as potatoes , cotton , and corn , that were endowed with a gene from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis , which produces a natural insecticide called bt toxin . field studies conducted in india in which bt cotton was compared with non - bt cotton demonstrated a 30 - 80 percent increase in yield from the gm crop . this increase was attributed to marked improvement in the gm plants ' ability to overcome bollworm infestation , which was otherwise common . studies of bt cotton production in arizona , u . s . , demonstrated only small gains in yield - about 5 percent - with an estimated cost reduction of $ 25 - $ 65 ( usd ) per acre owing to decreased pesticide applications . in china , where farmers first gained access to bt cotton in 1997 , the gm crop was initially successful . farmers who had planted bt cotton reduced their pesticide use by 50 - 80 percent and increased their earnings by as much as 36 percent . by 2004 , however , farmers who had been growing bt cotton for several years found that the benefits of the crop eroded as populations of secondary insect pest , such as mirids , increased . farmers once again were forced to spray broad - spectrum pesticides throughout the growing season , such that the average revenue for bt growers was 8 percent lower than that of farmers who grew conventional cotton . meanwhile , bt resistance had also evolved in field populations of major cotton pest , including both the cotton bollworm ( helicoverpa armigera ) and the pink bollworm ( pectinophora gossypiella ) .
