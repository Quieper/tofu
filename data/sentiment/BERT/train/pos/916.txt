for currently commercialized gm crops the environmental benefits as previously pointed out are primarily linked to reductions in pesticide use and to reductions in tillage ( christou & twyman , 2004 ; wesseler , scatasta , & el hadji , 2011 ) . reductions in pesticide use can lead to a greater conservation of beneficial insects and help to protect other non - target species ( aktar , sengupta , & chowdhury , 2009 ) . reduced tillage helps to mitigate soil erosion and environmental pollution ( wesseler et al . , 2011 ; brooke & barfoot , 2008 ) and can lead to indirect environmental benefits including reductions in water pollution via pesticide and fertilizer runoff ( christos & ilias , 2011 ) . it has been claimed that growing bt maize could help to significantly reduce the use of chemical pesticides and lower the cost of production to some extent ( gewin , 2003 ) . the deregulation process for gm crops includes the assessment of potential environmental risks including unintentional effects that could result from the insertion of the new gene ( prakash , sonika , ranjana , & tiwary , 2011 ) . development of gm technology to introduce genes conferring tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought or inundation , extremes of heat or cold , salinity , aluminum , and heavy metals are likely to enable marginal land to become more productive and may facilitate the remediation of polluted soils ( czako , feng , he , liang , & marton , 2005 ; uchida et al . , 2005 ) . the multiplication of gm crop varieties carrying such traits may increase farmers ' capacities to cope with these and other environmental problems ( dunwell & ford , 2005 ; sexton & zilberman , 2011 ) . therefore , gm technology may hold out further hope of increasing the productivity of agricultural land with even less environmental impact ( food and agriculture organization [ fao ] , 2004 ) .
