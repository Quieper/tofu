u . s . offshore wind installations in ocean waters deeper than 60 m could supply more than 1 , 200 gw of electric - generating capacity to the nation electricity system . at the same time , relatively high capital expenditures for deepwater wind - approximately 35 % of which can be attributed to substructure and installation expenses - challenge the economic viability of this resource . innovative technology developed by researchers at doe nrel has the potential to reduce costs by simplifying construction and maintenance logistics for deepwater wind systems in challenging offshore marine environments .
