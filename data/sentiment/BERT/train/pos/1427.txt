a geothermal heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground anywhere in the world to provide home heating , but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources . [ 13 ] the thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature . the most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux , ideally from using a hot spring . the next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer . if no adequate aquifer is available , an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock . this last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in europe , or enhanced geothermal systems in north america . much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers .
