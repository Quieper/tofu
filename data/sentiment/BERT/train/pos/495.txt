before that , though , some background : crispr is a molecule that can be programmed to target a specific sequence in a genome . it guides an enzyme , such as cas9 , to chop the code like tiny molecular scissors . scientists began using cas9 to cause " blunt end " breaks in dna . this tends to initiate a jerry - rigged repair ; the break is cobbled back together , incorporating small bits of available dna or a repair template of other genetic material that scientists might add . a cas9 repair is not always precise , but as the old saying goes , " a carpenter does not blame his tools . " but researchers have since found cpf1 , another such enzyme , which hack into double - stranded dna and leaves a " sticky end " break that leaves one strand dangling off the end . this template allows for more precise gene edit . and in december , u . c . berkeley scientists reported discovering yet more enzymes - casx and casy - which promise to make the technology even more versatile and exacting . in short , technical limitations are evaporating .
