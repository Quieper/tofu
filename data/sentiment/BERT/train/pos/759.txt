the new scalable offshore floating wind system , named " spiderfloat " for its modular components that resemble spider legs , is designed to substantially reduce expenses for deepwater substructures , driving down the cost of deepwater wind energy . ultimately , researchers hope this could make deepwater systems competitive with fixed - bottom offshore wind power plants .
