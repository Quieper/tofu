heat from earth interior generates surface phenomena such as lava flows , geysers , fumaroles , hot springs , and mud pots . the heat is produced mainly by the radioactive decay of potassium , thorium , and uranium in earth crust and mantle and also by friction generated along the margins of continental plates . the subsequent annual low - grade heat flow to the surface averages between 50 and 70 milliwatts ( mw ) per square metre worldwide . in contrast , incoming solar radiation striking earth surface provides 342 watts per square metre annually ( see solar energy ) . geothermal heat energy can be recovered and exploited for human use , and it is available anywhere on earth surface . the estimated energy that can be recovered and utilized on the surface is 4 . 5 × 106 exajoules , or about 1 . 4 × 106 terawatt - years , which equates to roughly three times the world annual consumption of all types of energy .
