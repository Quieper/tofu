last month , i had the honor of watching nyc mayor bloomberg sign a bill tasking the new york city office of long - term planning & sustainability to study geothermal energy resources and the feasibility of city - wide adoption of geothermal heating and cooling . as mayor bloomberg sustainability leadership - in an official capacity at least - comes to an end , his plans to ensure that the city mission to find sustainable , cost - effective solutions to combat air pollution are well underway . though the geothermal heating and cooling bill is very important , it is only one aspect of the mayor larger planyc effort .
