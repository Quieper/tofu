one of the biggest hurdles to the widespread adoption of solar power is variance in solar intensity . according to the national renewable energy laboratory , the sun provides almost twice as much energy to the mojave desert as it does to the pacific northwest . because a panel output depends on the amount of solar energy it receives , this means solar is a much better power source in southwest deserts than in other parts of the country . while a solar panel can provide at least some free electricity anywhere in the country , the investment will take much longer to pay for itself in regions without intense solar coverage .
