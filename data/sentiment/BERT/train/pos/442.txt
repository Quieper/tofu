before going solar you have a one - way connection to the grid . when you go solar , you create a two - way connection , meaning you both consume and generate power . since most people are away during the day when solar is producing energy , and home at night using power , the typical home will draw some power back from the grid when you need it just as you do now both day and night . power produced during the day is in essence ' stored ' in the grid .
