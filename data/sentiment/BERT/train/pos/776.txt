energy suppliers can build their wind turbines on pre - existing farmland and pay the farm owners to build on their property in the form of contracts or leases . this is a great boon to farmers who can use some extra income , and it wind turbine footprints take up very little space at the ground level , so it does not disrupt their farm production . at present , less than 1 . 5 % of contiguous u . s . land area is used by wind power plants . however , given all the plains and cattleland available on the interior of the country , there is a lot of opportunity for expansion if landowners and government land managers are up for it .
