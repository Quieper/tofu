deep geothermal sources provide efficient , clean heat for industrial processes and some large - scale commercial and agricultural uses . in addition , steam can be used to spin a turbine and generate electricity . although geothermal steam requires no fuel and low operational costs , the initial capital costs - especially drilling test wells and production wells - can be financially challenging . steam resources that are economical to tap into are currently limited to regions with high geothermal activity , but research is underway to develop enhanced geothermal systems with much deeper wells that take advantage of the earth natural temperature gradient and can potentially be constructed anywhere . enhanced systems can use hydraulic fracturing techniques to engineer subsurface reservoirs that allow water to be pumped into and through otherwise dry or impermeable rock .
