immunization protects future generations . vaccines have reduced and , in some cases , eliminated many diseases that killed or severely disabled people just a few generations ago . for example , smallpox vaccination eradicated that disease worldwide . your children do not have to get smallpox shots any more because the disease no longer exists . by vaccinating children against rubella ( german measles ) , the risk that pregnant women will pass this virus on to their fetus or newborn has been dramatically decreased , and birth defects associated with that virus no longer are seen in the united states . if we continue vaccinating now , and vaccinating completely , parents in the future may be able to trust that some diseases of today will no longer be around to harm their children in the future .
