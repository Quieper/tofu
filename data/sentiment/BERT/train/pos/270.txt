perhaps the best part of solar energy ? humans could ( hypothetically ) keep using this renwable energy source indefinitely . the u . s . department of energy even reports that , thanks to the sun , " 173 , 000 terawatts of energy strike the earth continuously " providing more than " 10 , 000 times the world energy use . " unlike other non - sustainable energy sources like coal or oil , solar power offers a nearly limitless amount of ( environmentally friendly ) energy .
