for example , suppose the maximum theoretical output of a two megawatt wind turbine in a year is 17 , 520 megawatt - hours ( two times 8 , 760 hours , the number of hours in a year ) . however , the turbine may only produce 7 , 884 megawatt - hours over the course of the year because the wind was not always blowing hard enough to generate the maximum amount of electricity the turbine was capable of producing . in this case , the turbine has a 45 percent ( 7 , 884 divided by 17 , 520 ) capacity factor . remember - this does not mean the turbine only generated electricity 45 percent of the time . modern wind farms often have capacity factors greater than 40 percent , which is close to some types of coal or natural gas power plants .
