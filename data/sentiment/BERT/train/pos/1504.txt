we do not vaccinate just to protect our children . we also vaccinate to protect our grandchildren and their grandchildren . with one disease , smallpox , we " stopped the leak " in the boat by eradicating the disease . our children do not have to get smallpox shots anymore because the disease no longer exists . smallpox is now only a memory , and if we keep vaccinating against other diseases , the same will someday be true for them too . vaccinations are one of the best ways to put an end to the serious effects of certain diseases .
