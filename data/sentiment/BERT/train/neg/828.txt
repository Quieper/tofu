fracking is a technique used to create fractures in the shale to allow gas to travel more easily from the rock pores where the gas is trapped , to the production well . in order to create fractures a mixture of water , sand and toxic chemicals is pumped into the rock under high pressure . when the fluid can no longer be absorbed the pressure causes the formation to crack or fracture and allows the gas to flow through the fractures to the well . some of the fracturing fluids are pumped out of the well and into surface holding pits or tanks but studies have shown that anywhere between 20 - 40 % of fracking fluids may remain underground .
