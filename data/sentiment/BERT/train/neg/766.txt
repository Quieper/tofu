all this makes much of the government attitude towards renewable energy at odds with its claim to being an international leader on tackling climate change . cuts to government support for solar power has led to a drop in the number of solar panels being installed , and continued political and financial backing for fossil fuels and nuclear power just do not make sense . the uk is legally committed to tackling climate change and , by 2050 , reducing emissions by 80 % compared to 1990 . there is pressure on all governments to get to zero carbon emissions even before 2050 if we have any hope of keeping global temperature rises below 1 . 5 degrees .
