although the deregulation of gm crops includes extensive assessments of possible human health impacts by competent authorities there are still many who hold concerns about the potential risks to human health of gm crops . for some this is related to whether transgenesis itself causes unintended consequences ( domingo , 2016 ) , while for others it is concerns around the traits that are possible using gm ( herman , 2003 ) . some criticize the use of antibiotic resistance as markers in the transgenesis procedure and that this can facilitate antibiotic resistance development in pathogen that are a threat to human health ( key , ma , & drake , 2008 ) . many critics of gm crops express concerns about allergenicity ( lehrer & bannon , 2005 ) . genetic modification often adds or mixes proteins that were not native to the original plant , which might cause new allergic reactions in the human body ( lehrer & bannon , 2005 ) . gene transfer from gm foods to cells of the body or to bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract would cause concern if the transferred genetic material unfavorably influences human health , but the probability of this occurring is remote . other concerns include the possibility of gm crops somehow inducing mutations in human genes ( ezeonu , tagbo , anike , oje , & onwurah , 2012 ) or other unintended consequences ( yanagisawa , 2004 ; lemaux , 2009 ; gay & gillespie , 2005 ; wesseler , scatasta , & el hadji , 2011 ) but commentary by these authors is speculative and is not based on experimentation with current gm crops .
