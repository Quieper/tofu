another limiting factor of solar energy is the space panels require . in order to make solar energy worth the cost of production and installation , you need to make sure there is enough room for your system to run efficiently . typically , a solar installation on a residential home features around 20 solar panels or 300 total square feet , which you can picture as five cars lined up . if you want to cover 100 percent of your home energy needs , you will probably need even more panels than that - around 28 to 34 .
