another application for geothermal is that of electrical generation . here , the green party ' makes hay ' by claiming that using existing deep wells for geothermal would be an easy way to put lots of unemployed oil and gas workers back to work . the assumption is that these workers have similar skills used in drilling , that can easily be transferred to managing deep oil wells for geothermal electrical generation . this is a questionable assumption because electrical generation is quite different than oil well drilling - and to date , there is no assurance that such deep oil geothermal electricity generation potential exists anywhere but a few places in alberta , bc and nwt , and some possible spots in quebec . ( smart prosperity just posted a blog on the first such initiative in saskatchewan . a pilot project is in development at swan hills )
