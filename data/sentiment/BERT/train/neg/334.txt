first , numerous studies of late have demonstrated that thousands of genetic variants straddled over the entire genome contribute to autism and psychiatric risk , as well as personality traits , and even intelligence . shank3 , dixdc1 , disc1 and c4 , some of our most promising candidate genes for autism or schizophrenia , contain variants which actually only increase risk by a fraction of a percentage point . for another , called grin1 , childhood stress can lessen its gene expression and impair learning . though neuropsychiatric conditions are highly heritable , no single genetic variant contributes much to the risk of inheriting them , and so it is not particularly feasible to correct through gene modification . the journalist david dobbs has elsewhere referred to these as " many assorted genes of tiny significance , " or magots .
