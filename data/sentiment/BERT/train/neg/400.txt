homes and small businesses often install solar panels on roofs . because that installation occurs on existing developments , photovoltaic systems do not usually consume large amounts of land that you could use for something else . solar - thermal systems , on the other hand , could use a large amount of land depending on the type of technology you use and the facility size . if a new solar energy installation requires land use , it could have a negative impact on wildlife habitat in the area . off - grid pv systems often have disposable batteries that store energy when the sun shine so you can use it at night . these batteries can harm the environment unless you dispose of them properly because some of them can leak toxin such as lead and sulfuric acid .
