as with all forms of power and heat generation , there are potential applications for geothermal in canada - but there are serious limitations as well . it is extremely unlikely that the mass of ~ 100 , 000 unemployed oil workers could be put back to work in a geothermal industry , nor do their skills directly transfer to geothermal power generation . likewise , the temperature differential in canada make geothermal only a potential provider of supplementary power , not a main provider .
