for currently commercialized gm crops the potential environmental impacts are mostly related to how these crops impact farming systems . some argue that because crops like roundup ready soybean greatly simplify weed management they facilitate simple farming systems including monocultures ( dunwell & ford , 2005 ) . the negative impact of monocultures on the environment is well documented and so this might be considered an indirect environmental effect of gm crops ( nazarko , van acker , & entz , 2005 ; buiatti , christou , & pastore , 2013 ) . other concerns that have been raised regarding gm crops include the effects of transgenic on the natural landscape , significance of gene flow , impact on non - target organisms , progression of pest resistance , and impacts on biodiversity ( prakash et al . , 2011 ) . again , many of these concerns may be more a function of the impacts of simple and broad - scale farming practices facilitated by gm crops rather than gm crops per se . however , there has been considerable concern over the environmental impact of bt gm crops highlighted by studies that showed the potential impact on monarch butterfly populations ( dively et al . , 2004 ) . this begged questions then about what other broader effects there may be on nontarget organisms both direct and indirect ( daniel , 2002 ) . in addition , there may be indirect effects associated with how gm crops facilitate the evolution of pesticide resistant pest in that the follow - on control of these pest populations may require the use of more pesticides and often older chemistries that may be more toxic to the environment in the end ( nazarko et al . , 2005 ) .
