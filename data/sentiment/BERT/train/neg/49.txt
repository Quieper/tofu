but when it comes to detoxification , stella metsovas , a gut health specialist and california - based certified clinical nutritionist , is quick to warn against placing too much faith in something marketing itself as a quick fix : " the golden rule of creating a healthy digestive tract is to never rely on a product for the relief of ailments like constipation , or that believing a supplement is going to detox your gut from harmful bacteria - they should always be considered as ' in addition to ' a healthy diet , " metsovas tells teen vogue . " nothing will magically detox your digestive tract - which includes your colon - unless your diet has a large percentage of plant - based fibers . "
