if the institute is the original site for this outbreak , the scientific community must apply pressure , demand full disclosure of their activities in the weeks leading up to december 19th , when the index case was reported . in all probability , what we are witnessing is a deliberate cover - up imposed by chinese authorities , not only on gauging or monitoring the corona cases , but on the conduct within the institute . it is almost inconceivable the central government purposefully green - lighted a leak , unleashed a rogue agent of such destructive force , jeopardizing their hold on the global economy with the express purpose of wiping out a major sector of their own population , without having considered the more serious , far - reaching implications - unless , of course , they did not know the true nature of the contagion . this would constitute an act of voluntary terrorism on their nation .
