csp plants that use wet - recirculating technology with cooling towers withdraw between 600 and 650 gallons of water per megawatt - hour of electricity produced . csp plants with once - through cooling technology have higher levels of water withdrawal , but lower total water consumption ( because water is not lost as steam ) . dry - cooling technology can reduce water use at csp plants by approximately 90 percent [ 3 ] . however , the tradeoffs to these water savings are higher costs and lower efficiencies . in addition , dry - cooling technology is significantly less effective at temperatures above 100 degrees fahrenheit .
