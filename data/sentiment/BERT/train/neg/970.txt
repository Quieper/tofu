' the mrsa acquisition rate was also increased : it was 3 . 53 % ( 3 . 53 cases per 100 admissions ) during the pre - sars period , 25 . 30 % during the sars period , and 2 . 21 % during the post - sars period ( p < . 001 ) . the vap rate was high , at 36 . 5 episodes per 1000 ventilator - days , and 47 % of episodes were caused by mrsathere were 30 episodes of vap in 22 patients , for a rate of 36 . 5 episodes per 1000 ventilator - days . this is much higher than the 90th percentile distribution for medical icus ( 9 . 6 episodes per 1000 ventilator - days ) or medical - surgical icus in major teaching hospital ( 12 . 1 per 1000 ventilator - days ) in the nnis system [ 11 ] . most of the organisms causing vap were mrsa ( 47 . 1 % of isolate ) , followed by stenotrophomonas species ( 29 . 4 % ) and acinetobacter species ( 14 . 7 % ) . during the sars period , there was a significant increase in the frequency of isolation of mrsa , stenotrophomonas species , and candida species and a significant decrease in the frequency of isolation of pseudomonas and klebsiella species . there were no differences among the 3 time periods , pre - sars , sars , and post - sars . ' during the most active sars phase , doctors in the emergency wards were having considerable difficulty distinguishing between incidence of sars vs . mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia cases , since sars and covid - 19 are quite closely aligned . eventually , we will have gathered sufficient data to determine precisely whether a bacterial co - infection is behind the lethality response seen in the human hosts . i also anticipate a large portion of the deaths are being caused by the intervention of drugs , mainly tamiflu , as occurred during the swine flu pandemic 10 years ago .
