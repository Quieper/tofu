solar energy devices may not harm the environment , but operations and maintenance activities at solar energy facilities might . excess noise , for instance , could disturb wildlife around a power plant . equipment and structures at a facility itself could cause problems . focused sun rays at a solar thermal plant might burn birds . workers at solar energy facilities must also use and dispose of cleaning agents carefully to protect the environment as well as life that lives in it . finally , concentrating solar power technologies ( parabolic trough and power tower ) may also generate substantial amounts of heat transfer fluids and industrial solid waste , such as lubricating oils , compressor oils , and hydraulic fluids .
