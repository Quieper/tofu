we have known for a long time the folly of genetic determinism : 30 , 000 genes cannot model 100 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 ( a hundred trillion ) synaptic connections in the brain . we also know that chronic stress and limiting social and economic factors are critically important to health , including cancer rates , cardiovascular and mental health , as articulated through well - known phenomena such as the " glasgow effect . " yet the nimh has taken the position to only fund research that entails a " neuro - signature , " which conveniently supports a drugmaker model and ignores the context of conditions . we are investing billions into data , yet every day i walked to work in cambridge , i walked past " methadone mile , " where there are plenty of homeless people suffering from panic and schizophrenia , without adequate resources - save for a half - million - dollar toilet . the promise that we can use gene modification , or even data , to eliminate psychiatric disorders is a fool errand . chronic stress matters . and genetic risk variants remain in the population because they are advantageous to certain people , given the right genetic background or conditions . those risk variants are speculating - evolution , always and forever , takes chances .
