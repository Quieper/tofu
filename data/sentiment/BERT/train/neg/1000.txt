this sentiment was echoed by a ( semi - mainstream ) journalist who interviewed me extensively in march ; as a lead - up to our highly controversial vrm vaccine summit . he subsequently admitted that there , were , indeed , forces behind the scenes , imposing pressure upon mainstream media outlets ( such as his own ) to suppress our overall message from getting out . he alluded to the fact that he was on our side , but that , as a journalist , his hands were tied by his higher - ups , and therefore he could not present a more balanced , informative report - the implication being that his directive , was , in fact , to discredit the anti - vaccine movement and deflect attention away from any meaningful discourse .
