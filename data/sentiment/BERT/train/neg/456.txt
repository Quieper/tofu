fossil fuels have a much more consistent output of energy . power plants know how much energy they are going to get for every measurement of fuel . they also have control over the fuel so they can consistently feed the same amount of fuel . this allows an accurate prediction of power creation . wind is not nearly as consistent , so wind energy will not be as reliable .
