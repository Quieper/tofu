air pollution is released at all stages of gas drilling operations , however , the volume of emissions from an individual well site generally do not meet the threshold that is required to have air permits , so the type and amount of air pollutants from tens of thousands of well sites that are projected for our state will not be tracked . the typical contaminants that come from fracking operations include : volatile organic compounds , such as benzene , which combines with nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere to form ground level ozone ; methane which is a powerful green house gas ; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) which cause cancer ; sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) which creates small particles that get lodged in the lungs and can lead to many health problems and acid rain . typical health problems include asthma , cancer , neurological damage , pulmonary reduction , coronary problems , endocrine disruption and headache . in the tupper green river basin in wyoming gas land , ozone levels are above those in los angeles on its worst days .
