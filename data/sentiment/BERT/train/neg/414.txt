one major problem with solar power is reliability . at best , a solar panel can produce electricity for 12 hours a day , and a panel will only reach peak output for a short period around midday . tracking panels that follow the sun can extend this prime generation period somewhat , but it still means that panels spend very little of the day producing at maximum capacity . storage batteries can charge during peak generation and provide a trickle of power at night , but they can be expensive , contain toxic materials and wear out quickly due to repeated charge and discharge cycles .
