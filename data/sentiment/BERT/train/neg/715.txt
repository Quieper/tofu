where statutory authority does not provide for premarket review , consultation is encouraged to reduce the risk of unintended harm to human or animal health . some fda regulated products , such as dietary supplements ( except certain new dietary ingredients ) , cosmetics ( except color additive ) , and food ( except food or color additive ) are not subject to mandatory premarket review . in these cases , fda relies on publicly available or voluntarily submitted information , adverse event reporting ( where applicable ) , and on post - market surveillance activities , to provide oversight . where nanotechnology applications are involved , fda encourages manufacturers to consult with the agency before taking their products to market . such consultation can help fda to advise companies , review safety information , and design any necessary post - marketing safety oversight .
