one of the main cons of wind energy is that wind is not a reliable source of energy . like every other weather phenomena , the wind is not something that we can rely on . not only are there places that are too sheltered to be windy enough , but even in windy areas , it is never windy enough for turbines to work at one - hundred percent capacity .
