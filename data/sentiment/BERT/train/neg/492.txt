wind turbines are now the largest flexible , rotating machines in the world . blade lengths routinely exceed 80 meters and towers rise well above 100 meters . as these machines continue to get larger , heavier , and operate under increasing structural loads , new materials and manufacturing processes are needed to address emerging issues of scalability , transportation , structural integrity , and end - of - useful - life recycling of materials .
