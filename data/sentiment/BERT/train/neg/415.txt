while solar generation is emission - free , the manufacture of solar panels and related technologies can involve some environmentally unfriendly substances . nitrogen trifluoride is a common byproduct of electronics manufacture , including those used in solar cells , and it is a greenhouse gas 17 , 000 times more potent than carbon dioxide . in addition , many solar cells include small amounts of the toxic metal cadmium , and the batteries required to store generated electricity can contain a host of other heavy metals and dangerous substances . as solar technology improves , manufacturers may be able to move away from these potentially dangerous substances , but for now , they mar the otherwise impressive ecological benefits solar power offers .
