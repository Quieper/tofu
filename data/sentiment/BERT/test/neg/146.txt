in the karoo situation , it has been modelled that within two months , the polluted groundwater from dolerite intrusion can move 6 kms to affect a neighbouring borehole . this means that this kzn midlands shale should not be mined or prospected to protect our ground - and surface - water . groundwater is recharged from the surface water and eventually flows to the surface naturally , " daylighting " into springs and seeps .
