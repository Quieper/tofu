" the downside of all of this is as soon as we move into the nanoparticle domain , then we need to also think about safety issues , and we can no longer still rely on all the things we know about chemicals from the last 100 years . " in particular , dawson and his team have made ground - breaking discoveries about how nanoparticles can draw proteins from a living system on to themselves , and this " corona " could influence what then happens to that particle . " one of the things we have learned is that nanoparticles can cover themselves with your own proteins and get caught up in the processing machinery , " he explains .
