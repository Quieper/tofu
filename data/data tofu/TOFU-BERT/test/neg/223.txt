who does not want to think that a delightful mixture of kale , twigs , tree sap , unicorn tears , and whatever gwyneth paltrow is raving about this week can make you pretty ? it is glitter in a bottle . right ? wrong . for one , most green juice are just sugar water . suja juice green supreme has 42 grams of sugar , no iron or b vitamin , and minimal protein . at $ 6 . 99 to $ 8 . 99 per bottle , you are getting . juice . similarly , blueprintcleanse , juice from the raw , and jus by julie are not magic keys to weight loss and well - being . all are cold - pressed , organic , and sell at astronomically high prices with vague promises of making you less gross .
