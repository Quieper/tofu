that is why the fda takes a slightly different approach with genetically engineered animal products . they have issued guidance to help developers meet the high standards of the codex alimentarius and u . s . food safety regulations . the center for veterinary medicine makes sure the animal is different in the way the developer says it is and that it is safe to eat . the fda is also required by the national environmental policy act to consider potential significant impacts of gmo animals on the environment , like how easily they could spread disease .
