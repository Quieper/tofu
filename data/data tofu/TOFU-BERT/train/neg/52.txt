the nighttime tea - billed as the " cleansing and detoxification tea " - is where the real weight loss , or " detoxification , " happens . this is largely due to senna root and leaf . senna is an fda - approved laxative used to treat constipation and clear the bowels of patients pre - colonoscopy . it works by irritating the colon to empty its contents and is known as a " stimulant " laxative . basically , ingesting senna is going to make you have go to the bathroom a lot . and afterwards you are going to feel lighter because you have successfully emptied out the entire contents of your intestines . while pooping out a pound or two might seem like an activity that is innocent enough , the laxative process is not usually quick or painless . as ridiculous as it sounds , trips to the bathroom can take hours to complete after senna use . it is why you will find warnings like " ensure you have ready access to a toilet during the day until you know how your body reacts to the tea " on nighttime detox teas .
