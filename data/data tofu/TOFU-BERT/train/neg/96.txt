if lab meat takes off , we might scale back the damage done by the huge and growing livestock industry . food animals account for at least one - sixth of the world greenhouse - gas emissions , and demand for meat is growing . ( some expect it to double by the year 2050 . ) growing beef or chicken in laboratory vats could also save trillion trillion of animal lives within a couple of decades . that is why i am sad to say that this well - intentioned project is such a waste of time . in fact , it is one of the worst good ideas of recent memory .
