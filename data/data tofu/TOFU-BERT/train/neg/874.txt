one cause for careful consideration with egs is the possibility of induced seismic activity that might occur from hot dry rock drilling and development . this risk is similar to that associated with hydraulic fracturing , an increasingly used method of oil and gas drilling , and with carbon dioxide capture and storage in deep saline aquifers . though a potentially serious concern , the risk of an induced egs - related seismic event that can be felt by the surrounding population or that might cause significant damage currently appears very low when projects are located an appropriate distance away from major fault lines and properly monitored . appropriate site selection , assessment and monitoring of rock fracturing and seismic activity during and after construction , and open , transparent communication with local communities are also critical .
