sarah lawrence * , an 18 - year - old student from calabasas , california , also tried a teatox program after seeing positive results on instagram . sarah chose to go with bootea , and could not wait to see results : " i had just come back from my first semester of college and really wanted to reset my body after having gained a few pounds during my first semester away . i ordered the 28 - day bootea cleanse and was really excited to try it . but the first night after taking the nighttime tea i got this splitting pain in my stomach at 3 a . m . it was one of the most horrible things i have ever felt - we are talking about a gut - wrenching pain . it was kind of scary because i did not know what was happening , all i knew was that i had drank the tea . " after ordering nearly a month worth of tea , sarah decided to try sticking with the program for a little longer : " i could not change the fact that i had already paid for all this tea . plus the nighttime cramps had eased off and by about two weeks i had already lost five pounds . it was around that point that i was supposed to get my period , but it did not come . my period is pretty regular so i started to worry when another week had gone by and it still had not shown up .
