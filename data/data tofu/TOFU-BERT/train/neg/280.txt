it is very difficult to understand this story as anything other than a piece of scientific hubris , more driven by the desire to experiment than by real compassion . but although it has been roundly condemned by genuinely distinguished scientists such as dr francis collins , it is unlikely to be the last such experiment . gene therapy used once to be denounced as " playing god " . that is no reason to abandon it . but if humans are to play god , they need to behave in a morally better way than unaided nature does . evolution itself might be described as a vast programme of genetic experiments conducted with no regard for the cost or consequences . if human beings are to take control of the process - and gene editing allows them at least to affect it - we must learn to take into account both cost and consequence , and to use our new powers responsibly .
