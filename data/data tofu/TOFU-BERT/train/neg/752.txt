lisa archer , director of the food & technology program at friends of the earth and herself a mother , wants federal agencies to protect the public : " like many parents and caregivers , i had to feed my child formula . i am outraged that these poorly studied , virtually unregulated and unlabeled nanomaterials are present in infant formula when there are suitable non - nano ingredients that have been used for decades and do not carry the same risks . the fda must act immediately to put a moratorium on the use of nanomaterials in formula and other food until they can be proven safe , and are regulated and labeled . in the meantime , formula companies must immediately commit to not use these materials .
