the whole idea , of course , is that lab - made meat can do much better because it is made from bovine stem cells : instead of 95 - percent authenticity , it will get to 99 percent or even higher . but there is little reason to be hopeful . it is true that scientists can make synthetic versions of natural products - much of the vanilla flavor in our food supply , for example , comes not from the vanilla orchid but a process of industrial fermentation . ( either way , the ingredient tastes pretty much the same . ) meat is a far more complicated substance , though - a mix of muscle , fat , tendons , ligament , and blood - and one that does not lend itself to " nature - identical " formulation . ( the life history of an animal also affects its taste , and makes it harder to recreate that taste by hand . )
