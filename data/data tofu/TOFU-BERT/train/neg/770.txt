the map was started 5 years ago - and the threat identified then has largely materialised . there is now a new threat of single turbines which can be up to 300 feet high . but wind farms and turbines are now being refused locally and these decisions are being upheld at appeal . two wind farms at spaldington were refused at appeal , as was a single turbine at wistow lordship . it takes a lot of effort but these results show that wind farm applications can be defeated by determined effort by village communities . the process is helped when appeals are called in by the secretary of state , eric pickles .
