the sars outbreak provides a road - map to better understanding and deciphering covid - 19 . the mechanism behind it was very similar , albeit the destructive force of this configuration is much greater . ' we have provided direct evidence that in addition to direct membrane fusion , sars - cov can enter cells through an endocytic route , and this endocytic infection leads to viral gene expression . endocytic entry could expand the cellular range of sars - cov , and may explain the replication of sars - cov in ace2 - negative colonic enterocytes and liver tissue 37 , because macropinocytosis - dependent entry does not require a specific receptorresults also suggest that sars - cov is able to enter cells through receptor - mediated , clathrin - independent , caveolae - independent endocytosis , likely through a process involving lipid raft . ' by all estimates , a large portion of victims categorized as having corona may have succumbed to bacterial pneumonia , triggered by flu - like symptoms , propelled by a bacterial co - infection , which was documented in 2009 - 10 during the height of the h1n1 pandemic . ' among 105 children and adults with fatal influenza ( us ) 7 - fold increased risk for invasive methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) . ' only time will tell whether this runaway virus is an anomaly or a genuine , lasting threat to human survival .
