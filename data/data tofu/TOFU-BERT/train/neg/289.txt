installing solar panels on your roof will save you money in the long run , but it is not a cheap purchase upfront . depending on which company you go with , it can cost a pretty penny , and is hard to figure out without input from companies and their quotes . rebates and tax credits can help reduce the cost , but unless you are saving up for this , it can be a huge detriment to someone looking to install solar . that said , solar prices have considerably dropped the past few years : the cost of a solar panel today is about $ 0 . 65 per watt , compared with $ 0 . 74 per watt a year ago and $ 4 per watt in 2008 .
