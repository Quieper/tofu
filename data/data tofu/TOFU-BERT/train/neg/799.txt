air and chemical pollution , including radioactive element radon , toxic elements arsenic , mercury , ammonia , boron ( highly toxic to plants ) and other polluting heavy metals . waste steam is sprayed over surrounding vegetation ( usually rare species in geothermal areas ) , while waste water is either reinjected ( inducing earthquakes ) , or pumped into streams and lakes untreated , as treatment is considered too costly to be economically viable . ( kristmannsdottir , 2003 ) . in lake Ã¾ ingvallavatn , a large area of the lake bottom was found to be biologically dead due to toxic hot waste water pollution from nearby geothermal plants , which is altering the lake ecology . hydrogen sulphide ( h2s ) is also emitted , causing a bad smell and forming the acid rain causing compound so2 in the atmosphere . emitted carbon dioxide ( co2 ) and h2s are heavy gases and can linger in valleys causing increased pollution for local populations .
