gm crops have also been criticized for promoting the development of pesticide resistant pest ( dale , clarke , & fontes , 2002 ) . the development of resistant pest is most due to the overuse of a limited range of pesticides and overreliance on one pesticide . this would be especially true for glyphosate because prior to the development of roundup ready crops glyphosate use was very limited and since the advent of roundup ready crops there has been an explosion of glyphosate - resistant weed species ( owen , 2009 ) . the development of resistant pest via cross - pollination to wild types ( weeds ) is often cited as a major issue ( friedrich & kassam , 2012 ) but it is much less of a concern because it is very unlikely ( owen et al . , 2011 ; ellstrand , 2003 ) . there are , however , issues when genes transfer from gm to non - gm crops creating unexpected herbicide resistant volunteer crops , which can create challenges and costs for farmers ( van acker , brule - babel , & friesen , 2004 ; owen , 2008 ; mallory - smith & zapiola , 2008 ) .
