in other words , laboratory meat only seems " real " - it only matches up with the taste you know and love - when mixed with additive to improve its color , flavor , and mouthfeel . but if that is true , then what is the point ? does a base of cultured cow cells really get us any closer to a perfect substitute for flesh than soy or wheat or mushroom ? last year , slate farhad manjoo raved about the latest veggie form of " chicken , " a product made from extruded soy paste that , in the words of its founder , gets " the proteins to align in a way that makes them almost indistinguishable from animal proteins . " sounds like dopey marketing to me , but farhad swear beyond meat is " 90 to 95 percent as realistic as chicken . "
