modern solar systems use components that radiate high levels of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation , which poses health risks to those with electromagnetic hypersensitivity ( ehs ) . the primary health hazard involved with solar energy generation is that people with ehs get sick from electromagnetic radiation in even very small amounts . such a health problem may be triggered by small frequencies from cell phones , computers and other electronic appliances . the production of solar energy can further aggravate the situation . since some of the symptoms of this health risk are common and non - specific , such as headache and restlessness , a person inside a solar - powered home or building may not even realize what is going on .
