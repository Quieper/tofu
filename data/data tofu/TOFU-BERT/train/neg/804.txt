there is a new , untested , alternative method proposed by geothermal proponents in canada - but the problem is that this form is untested . there is no large scale geothermal in operation in canada at present and no pilot project of this alternative method . therefore , it is not reasonable to set a nation energy generation and employment policy based on something that does not exist , and that requires a process that the green party election platform strictly forbid , that being fracking .
