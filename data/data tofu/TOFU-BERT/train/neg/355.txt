the wide distribution and adoption of cultured meat will not affect all farming economies equally , but the two on stage could be particularly impacted . both new zealand and wales are heavily grass - based farming economies ( much like ireland ) . since the countries get plenty of rain , and the grass grows without much effort , farmers have traditionally focused on dairy and forage . both countries also have relatively small populations and therefore depend on exports . both are also able to charge a premium for the products derived from the quality of their largely pastured cows and sheep .
