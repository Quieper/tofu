excerpts from the research report reveal an open - ended approach , which integrated bat - mouse genes , triggering haphazard , mutagenic responses , thereby successfully altering the sars virus into something far more unpredictable , by all accounts , a comparable blueprint for the subsequent covid - 19 strain currently unfolding its fury upon the globe : ' using the sars - cov reverse genetics system , we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus shc014 in a mouse - adapted sars - cov backbone . the results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the shc014 spike in a wild - type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the sars receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme ii ( ace2 ) , replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of sars - cov . additionally , in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis . evaluation of available sars - based immune - therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy ; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with covs using the novel spike protein . on the basis of these findings , we synthetically re - derived an infectious full - length shc014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo . our work suggests a potential risk of sars - cov re - emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations . ' the data delineates the earliest stages of a synthetic man - made chimera virus , articulating the precise viral mutations which manifested , derived from sars rna . given the track - record of shoddy protocols , with major laboratory breaches spreading infections documented throughout history , the chances of a genuine " spillover event " having occurred , either by human error , or by way of an intentional leak , conducted with malevolent intent , are high . in the event standard containment measures in the bio - lab interior unit were insufficient ; from discarded gloves , gown and dirty instruments , the altered virus may have been transported inadvertently to the external environment .
