the appeal of detox tea is straightforward and endlessly promising : drink me and be thin . you do not have to look very far to see detox tea companies equating thinness to health , and then turning around and selling you a thinner version of yourself in the convenient form of a celebrity - endorsed instagram post and a few dedicated swigs of tea . the sales model is one that detox tea giants like skinny mint , skinnyme , flat tummy tea , slendertoxtea , bootea , and skinny teatox have capitalized on . with promises of weight loss often directly in the company names , it is clear that " detoxing " has become a convenient euphemism for what these teas really are : glorified , and potentially harmful , weight loss supplements .
