one concern with open systems like the geysers is that they emit some air pollutants . hydrogen sulfide - a toxic gas with a highly recognizable " rotten egg " odor - along with trace amounts of arsenic and minerals , is released in the steam . salt can also pose an environmental problem . at a power plant located at the salton sea reservoir in southern california , a significant amount of salt builds up in the pipes and must be removed . while the plant initially put the salts into a landfill , they now re - inject the salt back into a different well . with closed - loop systems , such as the binary cycle system , there are no emissions and everything brought to the surface is returned underground .
