first of all , seven out of these ten states either outlaw or do not clearly state the legal status of third party ownership for solar panels . third party ownership basically means that home owners let a company install the panels on their house and then sign a contract or lease to pay them for the electricity . this setup occurs in 72 percent of residential solar installations , so when it is gone , so are people chances of solar energy when they do not have thousands of dollars lying around . states like alabama also lack policies promoting solar energy or mandates to expand their state clean energy supply .
