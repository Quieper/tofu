far from being the economic panacea that is promised by the gas companies , the socioeconomic impacts of fracking could have onerous effects on individuals and communities . it would increase the burden on local infrastructure to maintain the roads and bridges that would be damaged by heavy truck traffic ; increase costs to fund emergency personnel for emergency services to deal with industrial accidents ; increase the cost for law enforcement to deal with increased crime that traditionally follows the influx of out - of - state workers . rents would spike in communities and locals would be priced out of the market . property values would fall as the land was industrialized which would in turn lower tax assessments and decrease the income to municipalities . if you or your neighbor has a gas well , chances are you would not be able to sell your property , as most banks would not lend on properties that have industrial activity , and you could lose your title insurance for the same reason . existing local industries such as tourism , outdoor recreation and agriculture , would all be negatively affected , and the boom and bust nature of gas drilling would likely leave your communities in much worse shape after the drilling rigs leave .
