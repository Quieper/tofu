justification for gm crops on the basis of the need to feed the world is often used by proponents of the technology , but the connection between gm crops and feeding the world is not direct . gm crops are used by farmers and are sold primarily on the basis of their direct operational benefits to farmers , including the facilitation of production and / or more production ( mauro et al . , 2009 ) . farmers realize these benefits in terms of cost savings or increased production or both and are looking to increase their margins by using the technology . companies producing gm seeds can be very successful if they are able to capture a greater share of a seed market because they supply farmers with operational benefits such as simplified weed management ( blackshaw & harker , 1992 ) even if there are no productivity gains . in addition , the traits in gm crops on the market as of the early part of the 21st century are not yield traits per se but are yield potential protection traits that may or may not result in greater productivity .
