another major advantage of solar energy is that it is the chameleon of power . besides providing electricity through pv panels , sunlight can be converted into heat ( solar thermal ) and solar energy materials can even be incorporated into buildings , as windows for example . even when just considering solar electricity , large panels can power an entire school in buenos aires or a doctor office in nairobi . because solar panels can also be used to distill water in areas where clean water is rare , solar energy has the potential to make a life - altering impact on communities all over the world .
