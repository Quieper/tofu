more recently , the migration and toxicological profile of an organo - modified clay polylactic acid nanocomposite to be used as a fcm was evaluated . migration studies indicated that less than 10 mg per dm2 of the nanocomposite migrated in water , under the conditions of the experiment ( maisanaba et al . 2014a ) . further analysis of the food simulant indicated that the levels of metals measured were below the permitted values . in addition , the authors evaluated the potential toxicity of migration extracts both in vitro and in vivo . assessment of the potential cytotoxicity of the migration extracts in vitro , on two cell types representative of the digestive system and their ability to induce dna mutations , did not reveal any evidence of in vitro toxicity compared to control ( maisanaba et al . 2014a ) . furthermore , exposure of rats to the same migration extracts for 90 days in drinking water did not show evidence of toxicity in terms of oxidative stress , inflammation , clinical biomarkers and histopathological analysis ( maisanaba et al . 2014b ) .
