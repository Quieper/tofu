gm seed companies promised to raise productivity and profitability levels for farmers around the world ( pinstrup - andersen , 1999 ) . gm seed companies had expected gm crops to be adopted by farmers because the traits they were incorporating provided direct operational benefits for farmers that could be linked to increased profits for farmers ( hatfield et al . , 2014 ) . the proponents of gm crops have argued that the application of gm technology would fundamentally improve the efficiency , resiliency , and profitability of farming ( apel , 2010 ) . in addition gm seed companies argue that the adoption of gm crops helps to reduce the application of pesticides , which has a direct impact on the sustainability of the cropping systems ( lal , 2004 ) as well as profitability for farmers ( morse , mannion , & evans , 2011 ) . some have even suggested that the production of gm crops creates a halo effect for nearby non - gm crops by reducing pest pressures within regions that are primarily sown to gm crops ( mannion & morse , 2013 ) .
