the distribution of particle sizes in a gcc is much broader than for a pc of the same size - that is , there are many more large particles and many more small particles than in a pc , and the size of the largest of the particles ( the " top size " ) is much greater for a gcc than for a pc . the lower top size of a pc gives better impact resistance in plastics than with a gcc . the narrower particle size distribution allows the generation of high oil absorption , useful in certain applications .
