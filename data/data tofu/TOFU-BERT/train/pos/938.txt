genetic modification of insects has become an important area of research , especially in the struggle to prevent parasitic diseases . for example , gm mosquitoes have been developed that express a small protein called sm1 , which blocks entry of the malaria parasite , plasmodium , into the mosquito gut . this results in the disruption of the parasite life cycle and render the mosquito malaria - resistant . introduction of these gm mosquitoes into the wild could help reduce transmission of the malaria parasite . in another example , male aedes aegypti mosquitoes engineered with a method known as the sterile insect technique transmit a gene to their offspring that causes the offspring to die before becoming sexually mature . in field trials in a brazil suburb , a . aegypti populations declined by 95 percent following the sustained release of sterile gm males .
