solar panels work just fine in ambient light and will produce significant energy in the fog or on overcast days . in fact , solar panels are actually more efficient at cooler temperatures than hot ones . although this might seem counter - intuitive , consider that solar panels on a rooftop in cool , foggy san francisco produce only one percent less electricity than one in nearby sacramento , where it is sunny and hot . consider too that germany leads the world in residential solar right now , and does not have a sunny climate .
