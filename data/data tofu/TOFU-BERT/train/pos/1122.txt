new turbine models can now cope with a lot of turbulent weather conditions . the somewhat older models - some 10 - 15 per cent in total - sometimes suffer damage during heavy weather , despite all the precautions taken . in most cases , repair is still possible : the blades or the head are replaced , and then immediately by more advanced and better quality parts . nowadays , wind turbines are built for 25 to 30 years .
