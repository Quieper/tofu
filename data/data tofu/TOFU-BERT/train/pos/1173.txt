there are many advantages of geothermal energy . it can be extracted without burning a fossil fuel such as coal , gas , or oil . geothermal fields produce only about one - sixth of the carbon dioxide that a relatively clean natural - gas - fueled power plant produces . binary plants release essentially no emissions . unlike solar and wind energy , geothermal energy is always available , 365 days a year . it is also relatively inexpensive ; savings from direct use can be as much as 80 percent over fossil fuels .
