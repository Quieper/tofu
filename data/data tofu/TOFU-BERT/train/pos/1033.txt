the water from direct geothermal systems is hot enough for many applications , including large - scale pool heating ; space heating , cooling , and on - demand hot water for buildings of most sizes ; district heating ( i . e . , heat for multiple buildings in a city ) ; heating roads and sidewalks to melt snow ; and some industrial and agricultural processes . direct use takes advantage of hot water that may be just a few feet below the surface , and usually less than a mile deep . the shallow depth means that capital costs are relatively small compared with deeper geothermal systems , but this technology is limited to regions with natural sources of hot groundwater at or near the surface .
