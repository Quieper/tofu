no matter how scary pollsters make their question - " lab meat " ! - a significant percentage of people are eager to eat meat produced without the animal . indeed , even the most pessimistic polls show 20 % to 30 % of people willing to switch over to clean meat . that is 40 times the size of the current plant - based meat market , worth $ 40 billion to $ 60 billion per year in the united states alone . and clean meat will not be marketed in a vacuum . rather , it will be sold as the alternative to conventional meat from industrial animal agriculture .
