vaccines protect the " herd . " herd immunity ( or community immunity ) means that when a " critical portion " ( the percent of people who need to be vaccinated to provide herd immunity ) of a population is vaccinated against a contagious disease it is unlikely that an outbreak of the disease will occur so most members of the community will be protected . [ 61 ] children and adults who cannot be vaccinated due to age , poor health ( who are immune - compromised or undergoing chemotherapy , for example ) , or other reasons rely on herd immunity to prevent contraction of vaccine - preventable diseases . [ 62 ] an apr . 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the university of california at los angeles and california state university . because they could not verify their vaccinations , quarantining them raised the campus ' herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease .

[ 64 ] [ 124 ] in 2005 , an 18 - month - old amish girl contracted polio and spread the disease to four other unvaccinated children , but , because the community met the herd immunity threshold for the disease , there was no polio outbreak .
