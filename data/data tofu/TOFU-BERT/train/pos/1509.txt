geothermal heat pumps ( ghps ) take advantage of the relatively stable moderate temperature conditions that occur within the first 300 metres ( 1 , 000 feet ) of the surface to heat buildings in the winter and cool them in the summer . in that part of the lithosphere , rocks and groundwater occur at temperatures between 5 and 30 째 c ( 41 and 86 째 f ) . at shallower depths , where most ghps are found , such as within 6 metres ( about 20 feet ) of earth surface , the temperature of the ground maintains a near - constant temperature of 10 to 16 째 c ( 50 to 60 째 f ) . consequently , that heat can be used to help warm buildings during the colder months of the year when the air temperature falls below that of the ground . similarly , during the warmer months of the year , warm air can be drawn from a building and circulated underground , where it loses much of its heat and is returned .
