once this single cell has been modified , the scientist will treat it with naturally occurring plant hormones to stimulate growth and development . this one cell will start to divide ( which is the natural growth process for any organism ) and the resulting cells begin to take on specialized functions , until they become a whole plant . because this new plant was ultimately derived from a single cell with the inserted gene , all of the cells in the regenerated plant contain that new gene .
