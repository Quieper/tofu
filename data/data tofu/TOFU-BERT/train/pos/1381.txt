immunization protects others you care about . children in the u . s . still get vaccine - preventable diseases . in fact , we have seen resurgence of measles and whooping cough ( pertussis ) over the past few years . since 2010 , there have been between 10 , 000 and 50 , 000 cases of whooping cough each year in the united states and about 10 to 20 babies , many of which were too young to be fully vaccinated , died each year . while some babies are too young to be protected by vaccination , others may not be able to receive certain vaccinations due to severe allergies , weakened immune systems from conditions like leukemia , or other reasons . to help keep them safe , it is important that you and your children who are able to get vaccinated are fully immunized . this not only protects your family , but also helps prevent the spread of these diseases to your friends and loved ones .
