there is a great debate going on right now on the subject of genetically modified foods , or gmos . for some , the idea of gmo food is a good one because the modifications allow crops to become resistant to drought and infestations , letting more people have more regular meals . some research even shows that the world produces 17 % more food than it needs to produce to provide each current human with three squares per day !
