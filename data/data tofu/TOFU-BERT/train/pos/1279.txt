wind energy also saves billions of gallons of water every year . unlike thermal power plants , wind turbines require no water to produce electricity or cool power generating equipment . older , conventional power plants ( coal , natural gas , nuclear ) , use substantial amounts of water for cooling the plant . in fact , the power sector withdraw more water than any other sector in the u . s . , including agriculture . that means the more wind power the country uses , the more water that can be conserved .
