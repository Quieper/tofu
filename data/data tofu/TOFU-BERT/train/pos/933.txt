other gm plants were engineered for resistance to a specific chemical herbicide , rather than resistance to a natural predator or pest . herbicide - resistant crops ( hrc ) have been available since the mid - 1980s ; these crops enable effective chemical control of weeds , since only the hrc plants can survive in fields treated with the corresponding herbicide . many hrcs are resistant to glyphosate ( roundup ) , enabling liberal application of the chemical , which is highly effective against weeds . such crops have been especially valuable for no - till farming , which helps prevent soil erosion . however , because hrcs encourage increased application of chemicals to the soil , rather than decreased application , they remain controversial with regard to their environmental impact . in addition , in order to reduce the risk of selecting for herbicide - resistant weeds , farmers must use multiple diverse weed - management strategies .
