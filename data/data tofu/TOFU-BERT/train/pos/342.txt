due to a number of awesome solar incentives in the u . s . , solar panels can actually turn you a profit in addition to generating bill savings that pay off the cost of the system . solar renewable energy credits ( srecs ) and net metering are two key benefits of solar that allow you to earn bill credits ( or even extra cash ) as your system produces electricity . in these scenarios , you are being compensated for the electricity that your solar panels generate . if you live in a state where either of these incentives apply , you can expect both immediate and long - term returns from your solar investment .
