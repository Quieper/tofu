unfortunately for solar consumers , the sun does not shine continuously for twenty - four hours . the amount of daylight hours available for solar energy production differs depending on the time of year and where you live . people who live closest to the equator can take advantage of the most direct sun and the longest daylight hours compared to those who live in more northern and cloudy climates . ( southwest states = solar paradise ! )
