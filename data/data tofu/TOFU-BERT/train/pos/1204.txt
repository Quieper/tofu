the temperature at earth core exists at roughly 720 degrees fahrenheit . this is due to the decay of radioactive materials millions of years ago . the high temperature beneath the earth surface can produce enormous amount of energy that could produce several gigawatts of electricity . technically speaking , geothermal energy is a renewable source of energy that can produce energy as long as the earth exists .
