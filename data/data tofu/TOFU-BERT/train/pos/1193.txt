fabricating sahin design was far from easy , says schroen . ' eventually , we found cytocentrics , a development company that designs and produces microsystems , willing to seek the boundaries of its technology for us . ' ' realising sami design was a fantastic challenge , ' says cytocentrics product engineer arne heessels . ' to ensure that all of the oil droplets are exactly the same size , the channels may not differ from each other in the slightest . we therefore had to etch the holes with exceptional accuracy . we eventually decided to treat the top and bottom of the chip separately . but we had to ensure that the holes in the bottom plate would line up exactly with those in the top plate . that was an exceptionally tough technical challenge . we were therefore extremely pleased when a video showed that the chips made the exact droplets and mixture that sami and karin had intended .
