finally , genetic modification of humans via gene therapy is becoming a treatment option for diseases ranging from rare metabolic disorders to cancer . coupling stem cell technology with recombinant dna methods allows stem cells derived from a patient to be modified in the laboratory to introduce a desired gene . for example , a normal beta - globin gene may be introduced into the dna of bone marrow - derived hematopoietic stem cells from a patient with sickle cell anemia ; introduction of these gm cells into the patient could cure the disease without the need for a matched donor .
