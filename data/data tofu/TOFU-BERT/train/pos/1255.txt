the choice of which design to use is determined by the resource . if the water comes out of the well as steam , it can be used directly , as in the first design . if it is hot water of a high enough temperature , a flash system can be used ; otherwise it must go through a heat exchanger . since there are more hot water resources than pure steam or high - temperature water sources , there is more growth potential in the binary cycle , heat exchanger design .
