approximately 270 petajoules ( pj ) of geothermal heating was used in 2004 . more than half went for space heating , and another third for heated pools . the remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications . global installed capacity was 28 gw , but capacity factors tend to be low ( 30 % on average ) since heat is mostly needed in winter . some 88 pj for space heating was extracted by an estimated 1 . 3 million geothermal heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 gw .
