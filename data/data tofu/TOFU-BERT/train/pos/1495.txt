vrm critics have accused the vaccine industry of misrepresenting the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and influencing health policy decisions for financial gain . there is no evidence to support this claim and conversely , many groups profit by promoting the controversiality of vaccines , such as lawyers who receive fees , expert witnesses paid to provide testimony and to speak at conferences , and practitioners of alternative medicine offering ineffective and expensive medications , supplements , and procedures . in summary , the faculty of health sciences at sfu is dismayed and disappointed that the vrm group may have attempted to establish credibility by using sfu name to further promote dangerous misinformation about the efficacy and safety of vaccines . we advise the public not to make any connection between the scientific integrity of sfu and the vrm conference .
