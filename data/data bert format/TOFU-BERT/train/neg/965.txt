the rna - dependent rna polymerase serves as the skeleton key which latches on the ace2 enzyme . the trace mineral zinc ion zn2 + can effectively halt the viral replication process , potentially saving the life of a patient infected with the corona virus : ' positive - stranded rna ( + rna ) viruses include many important pathogen . they have evolved a variety of replication strategies , but are unified in the fact that an rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) functions as the core enzyme of their rna - synthesizing machinery . the rdrp is commonly embedded in a membrane - associated replication complex that is assembled from viral rna , and viral and host proteins . given their crucial function in the viral replicative cycle , rdrps are key targets for antiviral research . increased intracellular zn2 + concentrations are known to efficiently impair replication of a number of rna virusesby interfering with correct proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins . ' aids , ebola and coronavirus contain an identical t - cell disruptor component . this would be impossible for nature to replicate . it bears the signature of a bio - weapon .
