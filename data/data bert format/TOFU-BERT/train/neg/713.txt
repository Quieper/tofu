the blm said that they may want to use less turbines due to the super size of this new mega - concrete turbine . eolus told blm there could be as few as ten for this project . the question is where would they put a small project in that 38 , 000 acres ? possibly around crescent peak . it is full of patented mining claims and active mines , and blm would consider that the most disturbed area . but even at 4 mw , ten would only give them 40 mw .
