the unique coronavirus transcription mechanism allows the efficient expression of foreign genes simply by inserting these genes together with a trs into the coronaviral genome , as was demonstrated with several reporter proteinsit is clear , however , that the expression levels of coronavirus genes can be manipulated by changes in the trs , in the sequences flanking it , or in the position of the gene in the viral genome . ' trs : reference to the ' transcription regulatory sequences ( intergenic sequences ) which precede the genes and are homologous to the 3 ' end of the leader sequence . the trss probably serve as transcription termination or pausing signals , the nascent chain either resuming transcription at the same site or being joined to the leader sequence at the 5 ' end during negative - strand synthesis . the negative - strand sgrnas subsequently function as template for the production of the positive - strand sgrna .
