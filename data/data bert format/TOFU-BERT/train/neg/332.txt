crispr - cas9 , the new gene modification tool , which has been heralded as a means for inserting ourselves into evolution , is itself evolving as a technology , even as you read this . that technology itself can evolve means there is greater urgency for how we think of our biology : either as a machine ( which can break down and get new spare parts ) or as part of ecology ( whereby breakdown is not necessarily bad and can be part of growth , renewal or reorganization ) . crispr may be used to repair a gene that has a deficient product , such as an enzyme or receptor , or alter code that merely suggests of risk . ideas on how to use it change hourly . the method is here to last . the ethics will only get more fraught . but there is a bigger obstacle to the emergence of " designer babies " and gattaca - type dystopian futures : the principles of evolution .
