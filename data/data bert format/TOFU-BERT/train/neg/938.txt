at this stage , it is crucial to evaluate only the facts on the ground . without a doubt , covid - 19 has emerged as the result of decades of laboratory experimentation with virus technology and vaccines . we do know with certainty that the wuhan institute of virology , which specializes in researching coronaviruses transmitted by bats , formally conducted intensive studies , making alterations to the sars - corona viral template in december , 2015 . the level 4 bio - lab is situated adjacent to the market epicenter of the recent outbreak , where a majority of serious cases of corona were first documented . researchers working at the institute were deliberately tampering with the genetic template of the sars virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome , passaging the " shc014 " bat strain into mice . the process of synthetic replication of recombinant viruses , by way of a mechanically directed transference of genetic material , in vitro , from one species over into another , poses unlimited , abject risks to human health , given an uncontrolled release , environmental exposure to these unconventional host vectors . but the important unanswered question is , were their workers at the lab exposed to the viral contents , or did any discarded , contaminated material find its way into their water supply , finally ending up in the market , or was it transferred outside unsuspectingly ?
