billie and her friends were interested in trying one of the popular detoxes after seeing instagram users posting endlessly positive reviews about the program : " it seemed like there were so many people who had so many good experiences with it . it came across as this super - easy drinking tea that would make you feel so much healthier and better and be skinny , " she says . bile felt fine after drinking the daytime tea , but after drinking the nighttime tea she found her experience not going as planned : " i woke up at midnight with the worst cramps imaginable . it was a shock for it to be happening . i have never felt cramps like that ever . i was struggling to walk . " having seen only positive reviews for the tea , billie tried the nighttime tea twice more , deciding to write her first experience off as a one - off fluke . " but i got horrible cramps every time i used it , and the same thing happened to the two of my friends . "
