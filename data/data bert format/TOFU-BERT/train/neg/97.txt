what is wrong with frankenbeef ? some complain it is not as feasible - or sustainable - as we have been led to think . for now , the stuff is made from stem cells drawn from the necks of living cows , then dosed with antibiotics and bathed in blood from cattle fetuses . a much - cited blog post by synthetic biologist christina agapakis points out that replacing that fetal bovine serum with blue - green algae - the step that would finally take dead cattle out of the equation - would be very difficult , and so will making cell cultures big enough to feed the herd of human carnivores .
