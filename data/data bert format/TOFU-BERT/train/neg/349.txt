certain solar technologies require rare materials in their production . this , however , is primarily a problem for pv technology rather than csp technology . also , it is not so much a lack of known reserves as much as it is the inability of current production to meet future demand : many of the rare materials are byproducts of other processes rather than the focus of targeted mining efforts .
