the striking signature of covid - 19 is a match for hiv . the chances of this occurring in the environment without some form of artificial provocation are virtually nil . ' we found 4 insertion in the spike glycoprotein ( s ) which are unique to the 2019 - ncov and are not present in other coronaviruses . importantly , amino acid residues in all the 4 insert have identity or similarity to those in the hiv - 1 gp120 or hiv - 1 gag . interestingly , despite the insert being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence , 3d - modelling of the 2019 - ncov suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site . the finding of 4 unique insert in the 2019 - ncov , all of which have identity / similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of hiv - 1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature . this work provides yet unknown insights on 2019 - ncov and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus . ' uncanny similarity of unique insert in the 2019 - ncov spike protein to hiv - 1 gp120 and gag
