falling electricity production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes , as at poihipi and ohaaki . the wairakei power station has been running much longer , with its first unit commissioned in november 1958 , and it attained its peak generation of 173 mw in 1965 , but already the supply of high - pressure steam was faltering , in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157 mw . around the start of the 21st century it was managing about 150 mw , then in 2005 two 8 mw isopentane systems were added , boosting the station output by about 14 mw . detailed data are unavailable , being lost due to re - organisations . one such re - organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for poihipi ( started 1996 ) , and the gap in 1996 / 7 for wairakei and ohaaki ; half - hourly data for ohaaki first few months of operation are also missing , as well as for most of wairakei history .
