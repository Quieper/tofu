direct geothermal heating systems contain pumps and compressor , which may consume energy from a polluting source . this parasitic load is normally a fraction of the heat output , so it is always less polluting than electric heating . however , if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels , then the net emissions of geothermal heating may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat . for example , a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size . [ 37 ] therefore , the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid .
