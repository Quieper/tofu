coronaviruses contain a single - stranded , positive - sense rna genome of about 30 kb , which is capped , polyadenylated , and infectious . all coronaviruses contain a common set of essential genes , of which the open reading frames ( orfs ) 1a and 1b , encoding the replicase functions , comprise the first two - thirds of the genome . downstream therefrom , the essential genes encoding the structural proteins are located , invariably in the order 5 ' - s - e - m - n - 3 ' . interspersed between these genes , clusters of group - specific genes occur that are homologous within each group but differ profoundly between the groups . the group - specific genes are accessory genes , as demonstrated by the observed viability of natural and engineered deletion mutants lacking some or all of these genes .
