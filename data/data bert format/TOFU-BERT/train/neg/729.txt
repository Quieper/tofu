henry county citizens are fighting off three wind companies while election results seemed to be an unofficial referendum on wind development in the county , and the people voted for no wind candidates ! their no wind henry county group put forth strong candidates for some key seats in their county and won every election they had a candidate running ! ed tarantino won the commissioner race , susan huhn , peg stefandel and kenon gray won county council seats . we need more citizens across the state who care about the wind issue to take this important step and run for office and local change . new county council member susan huhn was elected president of the board .
