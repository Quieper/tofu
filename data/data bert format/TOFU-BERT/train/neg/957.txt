' our analysis of the spike glycoprotein of 2019 - ncov revealed several interesting findings : first , we identified 4 unique insert in the 2019 - ncov spike glycoprotein that are not present in any other coronavirus reported till date . to our surprise , all the 4 insert in the 2019 - ncov mapped to short segments of amino acids in the hiv - 1 gp120 and gag among all annotated virus proteins in the ncbi database . this uncanny similarity of novel insert in the 2019 - ncov spike protein to hiv - 1 gp120 and gag is unlikely to be fortuitous . further , 3d modelling suggests that at least 3 of the unique insert which are non - contiguous in the primary protein sequence of the 2019 - ncov spike glycoprotein converge to constitute the key components of the receptor binding site . of note , all the 4 insert have pi values of around 10 that may facilitate virus - host interactions . taken together , our findings suggest unconventional evolution of 2019 - ncov that warrant further investigation . our work highlights novel evolutionary aspects of the 2019 - ncov and has implications on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of this virus .
