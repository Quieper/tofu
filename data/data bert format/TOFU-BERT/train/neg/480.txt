it is true that wind turbines do not produce any air pollution but they create visual and noise pollution . many people would object to the way wind turbines look and the negative visual impact they create , particularly , in the countryside . also , wind turbines are noisy . often this is not an issue as wind farms are located in remote rural locations . but that is not always the case . so their potential for noise pollution needs to be taken into account , as most people would not be happy living nearby a wind turbine , let alone several of them .
