the out crossing of gm crops to non - gm crops or related wild type species and the adventitious mixing of gm and non - gm crops has led to a variety of issues . because of the asynchrony of the deregulation of gm crops around the world , the unintended presence of gm crops in food and feed trade channels can cause serious trade and economic issues . one example is " libertylink " rice , a gm variety of rice developed by bayer crop science , traces of which were found in commercial food streams even before it was deregulated for production in the united states . the economic impact on u . s . rice farmers and miller when rice exports from the united states were halted amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars ( bloomberg news , 2011 ) . a more recent example is agrisure viptera corn , which was approved for cultivation in the united states in 2009 but had not yet been deregulated in china . exports of u . s . corn to china contained levels of viptera corn , and china closed its borders to u . s . corn imports for a period . the national grain and feed association ( ngfa ) had encouraged syngenta to stop selling viptera because of losses u . s . farmers were facing , and there is an ongoing class - action lawsuit in the united states against syngenta ( u . s . district court , 2017 ) . concerns over the safety of gm food have played a role in decisions by chinese officials to move away from gm production . cross - pollination can result in difficulty in maintaining the gm - free status of organic crops and threaten markets for organic farmers ( ellstrand , prentice , & hancock , 1999 ; van acker , mclean , & martin , 2007 ) . the eu has adopted a gm and non - gm crop coexistence directive that has allowed nation - states to enact coexistence legislation that aims to mitigate economic issues related to adventitious presence of gm crops in non - gm crops ( van acker et al . , 2007 ) .
