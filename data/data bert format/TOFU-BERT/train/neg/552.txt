some critics of gm crops express concerns about how certain gm traits may provide substantive advantages to wild type species if the traits are successfully transferred to these wild types . this is not the case for gm ht traits , which would offer no advantage in non - cropped areas where the herbicides are not used , but could be an issue for traits such as drought tolerance ( buiatti , christou , & pastore , 2013 ) . this situation would be detrimental because the gm crops would grow faster and reproduce more often , allowing them to become invasive ( fao , 2015 ) . this has sometime been referred to as genetic pollution ( reichman et al . , 2006 ) . there are also some concerns that insects may develop resistance to the pesticides after ingesting gm pollen ( christou , capell , kohli , gatehouse , & gatehouse , 2006 ) . the potential impact of genetic pollution of this type is unclear but could have dramatic effects on the ecosystem ( stewart et al . , 2003 ) .
