geothermal energy production is not an easy pursuit . drilling into hot rocks is a daunting task . for any geothermal process to start , the required temperature must be present ( the very least is 350 degrees fahrenheit ) . a temperature lower than 350 degrees fahrenheit may not be able to generate geothermal energy .
