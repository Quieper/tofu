the process of fracking requires millions of gallons of water , which are drawn from area lakes and rivers and transported in large 18 wheeler trucks over local roads . each million gallons of water in fracking fluid includes 40 , 000 lbs . of chemicals . therefore , conservatively , if each individual fracking uses 3 , 000 , 000 to 6 , 000 , 000 gallons of water there will be anywhere from 120 , 000 lbs . up to 240 , 000 lbs . of chemicals . there are reports of some fracking operations taking up to 8 , 000 , 000 gallons - that is 320 , 000 lbs . of chemicals that will be shipped over our local roads to be mixed onsite with the 800 tractor trailer loads of water . if 70 % is recovered from the well that is 5 , 600 , 000 gallons of contaminated water to be shipped to a wastewater facility in 560 tractor trailers . this is one well , one fracking operation . there are multiple frackings done at one well and new york state is planning tens of thousands of wells across the state . ( this is based on a tractor trailer load carrying 10 , 000 gallons a load . )
