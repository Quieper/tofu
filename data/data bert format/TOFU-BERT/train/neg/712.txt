standard turbines ( 450 feet tall ) may be considered outdated technology . the utilities are far more interested in photovoltaic solar projects . so this company wants 4 megawatt turbines which would be 750 feet tall . there is a demonstration project using these in iowa , and we have seen on at tehachapi pass in ca . this would be an even larger visual intrusion to surrounding landscapes than older large wind turbine generator models .
