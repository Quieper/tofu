the temptation to authorize sweeping vaccine policy on all citizens will be extremely high , and this will be encouraged by the cdc and the who . we must be ready for that scenario . if the virus spread is not successfully contained in the coming months , look for geographic indicators , like military checkpoint in urban centers , and media saturation introducing the vaccine as safe and effective . according to dr . lisa jackson , the kaiser permanente study leader behind a corona vaccine prototype , " we do not know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response , or whether it will be safe . " dr peter hotez , dean of the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine , who worked on the sars vaccine , and ' found that some vaccinated animals developed more severe disease compared with unvaccinated animals when they were exposed to the virus ' has gone so far as to say , " i understand the importance of accelerating timeline for vaccines in general , but from everything i know , this is not the vaccine to be doing it with . there is a risk of immune enhancement . the way you reduce that risk is first you show it does not occur in laboratory animals . " this strategy led to pulmonary immunopathology in sars vaccinated mice , in effect creating the condition in healthy mice , worsening any existing mitigating factors , thereby hastening the incidence of an adverse respiratory response . it neither right nor prudent to force a rushed , potentially dangerous product on families which has not been tested on animals , making it a real - time human trial without a safety net for recipients .
