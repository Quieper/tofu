microbes and microbial products are fed growth medium that contains testable high - risk inputs . the non - gmo project standard requires that the microbes themselves are not gmo , and it also requires that testable major high - risk inputs to the growth medium are tested when the microbe or microbial product is a major input or ingredient in a verified product . much like non - gmo project verified milk must come from cows fed non - gmo feed , microbes and microbial products in a verified product must be fed a non - gmo growth medium .
