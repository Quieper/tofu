another obstacle to solar electricity is photovoltaic efficiency . if you live in the desert , a single square meter of solar panel could receive the equivalent of more than 6 kilowatt - hours of energy in the course of a single day . but a solar panel cannot convert that entire amount of energy to electricity . the efficiency of a solar panel determines how much of that power is usable , and most commercial solar panels on the market in 2013 have efficiency ratings of less than 25 percent . the more efficient a panel is , the more expensive it is to produce . barring any major leaps in technology , efficiency ratings beyond 33 percent are unlikely in the near future .
