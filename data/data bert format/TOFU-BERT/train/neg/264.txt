rooftop solar panels are installed by connecting a mounting system ( also known as " racking " ) to your roof . certain roofing materials used in older or historical homes , such as slate or cedar tiles , can be difficult for solar installers to work with , throwing up a roadblock for solar power . additionally , many homes and apartment buildings have skylights or other rooftop additions like roof decks that can make the solar installation process difficult or costly . in the long run , however , this should not be a barrier to the mass adoption of solar power in the u . s . if your home does not qualify for a rooftop solar installation , you still have options : ground - mounted solar panels or buying a share in a community solar garden can get you around this disadvantage of solar energy .
