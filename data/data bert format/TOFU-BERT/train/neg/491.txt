wind energy suffers from what is called intermittency , which is a disruption caused by the inconsistency of the wind itself . since wind can blow at various speeds , it is hard to predict the amount of energy it can collect at a given time . this means suppliers and cities need to have an energy reserve or alternative sources of power in case the winds die down for longer lengths of time .
