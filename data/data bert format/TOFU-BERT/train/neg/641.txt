practical concerns around gm crops include the rise of insect pest and weeds that are resistant to pesticides . other concerns around gm crops include broad seed variety access for farmers and rising seed costs as well as increased dependency on multinational seed companies . citizens in many countries and especially in european countries are opposed to gm crops and have voiced concerns about possible impacts on human and environmental health . nonetheless , proponents of gm crops argue that they are needed to enhance worldwide food production . the novelty of the technology and its potential to bring almost any trait into crops mean that there needs to remain dedicated diligence on the part of regulators to ensure that no gm crops are deregulated that may in fact pose risks to human health or the environment . the same will be true for the next wave of new breeding technologies , which include gene editing technologies .
