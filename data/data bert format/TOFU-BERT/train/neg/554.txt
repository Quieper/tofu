repeated use of a single pesticide over time leads to the development of resistance in populations of the target species . the extensive use of a limited number of pesticides facilitated by gm crops does accelerate the evolution of resistant pest populations ( bawa & anilakumar , 2013 ) . resistance evolution is a function of selection pressure from use of the pesticide and as such it is not directly a function of gm ht crops for example , but gm ht crops have accelerated the development of glyphosate resistant weeds because they have promoted a tremendous increase in the use of glyphosate ( owen , 2009 ) . farmers have had to adjust to this new problem and in some cases this had added costs for farmers ( mauro , mclachlan , & van acker , 2009 ; mannion & morse , 2013 ) . the management of gm ht volunteers has also produced challenges for some farmers . these are not resistant weeds as they are not wild type species , but for farmers they are herbicide resistant weeds in an operational sense ( knispel , mclachlan , & van acker , 2008 ; liu et al . , 2015 ) . pink bollworm has become resistant to the first generation gm bt cotton in india ( bagla , 2010 ) . similar pest resistance was also later identified in australia , china , spain , and the united states ( tabashnik et al . , 2013 ) . in 2012 , army worms were found resistant to dupont - dow bt corn in florida ( kaskey , 2012 ) , and the european corn borer is also capable of developing resistance to bt maize ( christou et al . , 2006 ) .
