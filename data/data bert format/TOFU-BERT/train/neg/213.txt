the pv cell manufacturing process includes a number of hazardous materials , most of which are used to clean and purify the semiconductor surface . these chemicals , similar to those used in the general semiconductor industry , include hydrochloric acid , sulfuric acid , nitric acid , hydrogen fluoride , 1 , 1 , 1 - trichloroethane , and acetone . the amount and type of chemicals used depends on the type of cell , the amount of cleaning that is needed , and the size of silicon wafer [ 4 ] . workers also face risks associated with inhaling silicon dust . thus , pv manufactures must follow u . s . laws to ensure that workers are not harmed by exposure to these chemicals and that manufacturing waste products are disposed of properly .
