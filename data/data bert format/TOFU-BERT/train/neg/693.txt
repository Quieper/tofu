the united states shale gas boom has precipitated global interest in the development of unconventional oil and gas resources . recently , government ministers in the united kingdom started granting licenses that will enable companies to begin initial exploration for shale gas . meanwhile , concern is increasing among the scientific community about the potential impacts of shale gas and other types of unconventional natural gas development ( ugd ) on human health and the environment . although significant data gaps remain , there has been a surge in the number of articles appearing in the scientific literature , nearly three - quarters of which has been published since the beginning of 2013 . important lessons can be drawn from the ugd experience in the united states . here we explore these considerations and argue that shale gas development policies in the uk and elsewhere should be informed by empirical evidence generated on environmental , public health , and social risks . additionally , policy decisions should take into account the measured effectiveness of harm reduction strategies as opposed to hypothetical scenarios and purported best practices that lack empirical support .
