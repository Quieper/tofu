soon after scientists reported in 2012 that crispr can edit dna , experts raised concerns about " off - target effects , " meaning genes that scientists did not intend to change inadvertently got deleted or altered . that can happen because one molecule in the crispr system acts as a molecular bloodhound , sniffing around the genome until it finds a match to its own sequence of a , t , c , and g ; unfortunately , in the 6 billion such letters of the human genome , there can be more than one match . the proposed crispr experiment , which would be led by scientists at the university of pennsylvania , would use three of these molecular bloodhounds , tripling the risk of off - target effects .
