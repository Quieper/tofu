the production of solar panels also requires the use of rare metals , including tellurium . this is a by - product from mined copper and is mostly found in high concentrations in mexico and china . there has been on - going debate by environmentalists and scientists regarding whether the supply of tellurium will be able to meet the ever - growing needs of the solar - cell production industry , as this metal is also used in other electrical industries , for semi - conductor purposes . it is currently second only to gold in terms of its rarity and consumption has been rising steadily over the past ten years or so . with this the price of tellurium is also rising ; it has more than doubled in the last five years . higher manufacturing costs will of course lead to higher retail prices for consumers interested in purchasing solar panels . tellurium is often thought to be the ' holy grail ' element when it comes to photovoltaics , however if this is the case , manufacturers will need to look at ways in which to overcome its scarcity .
