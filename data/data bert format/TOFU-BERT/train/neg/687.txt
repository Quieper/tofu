construction of geothermal power plants has the potential to cause surface instability and trigger earthquakes . conventional geothermal power plant construction involves drilling hot rock that contains trapped water or steam in its pores spaces and natural fractures . when these fractures are intersected by a drilled hole , the trapped water erupts as steam due to instant drop in pressure . the drilling its self may not trigger earthquakes , but the rupturing of steam and subsequent return of the used water to the hot water reservoir could . the cycle leads to instabilities along fracture lines resulting to an earthquake .
