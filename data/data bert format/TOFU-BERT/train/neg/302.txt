the experiment would alter the immune system t cells only after they are removed from a patient . that gives scientists the chance to screen the crispr ' d cells to make sure only the three intended genes , all involved in making t cells find and destroy tumor cells , are altered . but after those t cells are infused back into a patient to fight melanoma , sarcoma , or myeloma , the crispr system can keep editing dna , and tracking such edit becomes like following a polar bear in a snowstorm .
