" many parents and caregivers have to feed their children formula , " explains kendra klein , phd , staff scientist at food & technology program at friends of the earth . " it is reprehensible that companies like gerber can expose babies to poorly studied , virtually unregulated and unlabeled nanomaterials in infant formula . suitable alternative ingredients have been used for decades that do not carry the same risks . we are calling for an immediate moratorium on the use of nanomaterials in formula and other food until they can be demonstrated to be safe and are regulated and labeled . formula companies must commit to not use these materials right now .
