there are approximately 15 , 000 wastewater treatment plants in the united states , but they were designed to filter out urine , fecal matter , and dangerous microbes . none of them were meant to remove plastics , especially something as tiny as microplastics . while studies suggest that most treatment facilities do manage to remove somewhere between 75 % and 99 % of microplastics , that still means that billions of microplastic particles still manage to make it into the fresh water supply , and even into the water we drink and serve our families . a study from earlier this year found that americans eat , drink , and inhale at between 74 , 000 and 121 , 000 microplastic particles each and every year .
