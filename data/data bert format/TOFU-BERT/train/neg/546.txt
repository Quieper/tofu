the production of gm crops is not equal across the world and in some jurisdictions there is little or no production . countries in the european union ( eu ) are a notable example in this regard . the near complete moratorium on the production of gm crops in the eu is based on common public view and political decisions rather than gm food safety assessment ( fischer , ekener - petersen , rydhmer , & edvardsson bjornberg , 2015 ) . this is also true for switzerland , where , for example , since 2005 gm foods and crops have been banned because of strong negative views on the part of both swiss farmers and citizens ( mann , 2015 ) . five eu countries ( spain , portugal , the czech republic , slovakia and romania ) accounted for 116 , 870 hectares of bt maize cultivation in 2015 , down 18 % from the 143 , 016 hectares in 2014 . the leading eu producer is spain , with 107 , 749 hectares of bt maize in 2015 , down 18 % from the 131 , 538 hectares in 2014 ( james , 2015a ) . russia is the world largest gm - free zone ( james , 2015a ) . despite the claimed benefits over risks , and the wide adoption of biotech - improved crop varieties in many parts of the world , europe and africa still remain largely gm - free in terms of production ( paarlberg , 2008 ) . this may be due in part to the relative absence of reliable public scientific studies on the long - term risks of gm crops and foods and the seed monopoly that is linked to gm technology development ( paarlberg , 2008 ) . in asia , four countries , including turkey , have banned gm crops . the gm concerns in europe have also slowed down the approval of gm crops in many developing countries because of impacts on agricultural exports ( inghelbrecht , dessein , & huylenbroeck , 2014 ) . many african governments have been slow to approve , or have sometimes even banned gm crops , in order not to lose export markets and to maintain positive relations with the eu , especially given implications for development aid ( wafula , waithaka , komen , & karembu , 2012 ) . in addition , a few african nations have banned gm cultivation over fears of losing european markets ( isa , 2015 ) . public concerns over gm crops and foods have also had an impact on production of gm crops in north america . the withdrawal of the gm bt potato ( newleaf â„¢ ) varieties from the north american market due to the concerns of two of the largest buyers of processing potatoes ( frito - lay and mcdonald ) was the result of feared consumer rejection ( kynda & moeltner , 2006 ) .
