one possible reason for solar higher price tag is a variety of " soft costs " included in the production of solar energy . these refer to the costs of installing and maintaining solar that do not have to deal with the actual hardware . for instance , soft costs can include permit fees , sales tax , customer acquisition and supply chain expenses . the cost for solar panels themselves has dropped by 60 percent since 2010 - but the costs for just customer acquisition actually grew by 10 percent in 2016 .
