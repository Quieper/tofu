even some variants that are highly compromising stick around by piggy - backing on other useful genes that are under natural selection . last year , tobias lenz , a scientist at the max - planck institute for evolutionary biology in germany , reported that a region of the genome called the major histocompatibility complex , which creates an immune system component that detect an array of infections , is littered with mutations . many of these mutations also associate with human diseases , cancer , autoimmune disease and schizophrenia . the advantage of altering immune system genes , then , may come with a tradeoff of removing genes that are " hitchhiking " nearby and dispose an associated risk for cancer or neuropsychiatric disorders . losing the bad can mean losing the good , too .
