3 . recycling - what happens when solar panels break or are decommissioned ? although solar panel recycling has not become a major issue yet , it will in the coming decades as solar panels need to be replaced . when solar panels break , it is possible they may leak chemicals which are sealed in a functional module . if solar panels are not disposed of properly , chemical leaking may be a more widespread issue . these issues are exacerbated in poorer countries that do not have as robust of recycling infrastructure as north america or europe .
