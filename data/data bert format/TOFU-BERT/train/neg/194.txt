1 . energy demand - solar requires a significant amount of energy up front to produce . mining , manufacturing and transportation all require substantial amounts energy . quartz must be processed , and cleaned and then manufactured with other components which may come from different facilities ( aluminum , copper etc . . . ) to produce a single solar module . heating the quartz during the processing stage requires very high heat . manufacturing requires combining multiple materials with incredible precision to produce high efficiency panels . all of this requires lots of up - front energy . with traditional fuels such as gas or goal , they are extracted , cleaned / processed and burned at very large scales , typically in a single location .
