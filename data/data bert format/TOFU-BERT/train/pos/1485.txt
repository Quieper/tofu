no . many vaccine - preventable diseases that we do not see much in the united states still make people sick in other countries . so it is possible for travelers to bring these diseases back to the united states , where they could then spread . if we stop getting vaccinated , we will not be protected from these diseases - community immunity protects us only if enough people continue to get vaccinated .
