another example of a gm crop is " golden " rice , which originally was intended for asia and was genetically modified to produce almost 20 times the beta - carotene of previous varieties . golden rice was created by modifying the rice genome to include a gene from the daffodil narcissus pseudonarcissus that produces an enzyme known as phyotene synthase and a gene from the bacterium erwinia uredovora that produces an enzyme called phyotene desaturase . the introduction of these genes enabled beta - carotene , which is converted to vitamin a in the human liver , to accumulate in the rice endosperm - the edible part of the rice plant - thereby increasing the amount of beta - carotene available for vitamin a synthesis in the body . in 2004 the same researchers who developed the original golden rice plant improved upon the model , generating golden rice 2 , which showed a 23 - fold increase in carotenoid production .
