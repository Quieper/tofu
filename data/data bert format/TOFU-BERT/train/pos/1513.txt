the first geothermal electric power generation also took place in larderello , with the development of an experimental plant in 1904 . the first commercial use of that technology occurred there in 1913 with the construction of a plant that produced 250 kilowatts ( kw ) . geothermal power plants were commissioned in new zealand starting in 1958 and at the geysers in northern california in 1960 . the italian and american plants were dry steam facilities , where low - permeability reservoirs produced only steam . in new zealand , however , high - temperature and high - pressure water emerges naturally as a mixture made up of 80 percent superheated water and 20 percent steam . the steam coming directly from the ground is used for power generation right away . it is sent to the power plant through pipes . in contrast , the superheated water from the ground is separated from the mixture and flashed into steam . most geothermal plants at present are of this latter " wet steam " type .
