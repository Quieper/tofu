the green revolution was driven by global hunger , and some argue that the next agricultural production revolution , which is perhaps being sparked by the introduction of gm crops , would be driven by other global needs including sustainability and the needs of individuals ( lipton & longhurst , 2011 ) . the green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s depended on the use of fertilizers , pesticides , and irrigation methods to initiate favorable conditions in which high yielding modern varieties could thrive . between 1970 and 1990 , fertilizer use in developing countries rose by 360 % while pesticide use increased by 7 to 8 % annually . the environmental impacts of the adoption of these technologies did in some cases override their benefits . these impacts included polluted land , water , and air , and the development of resistant strains of pest . gm crops could be used to sustain or grow production levels while diminishing environmental impacts yet despite the rapid adoption of gm crops many of the problems associated with the green revolution remain ( macnaghten & carro - ripalda , 2015 ) . the pros and cons of gm crops are many and diverse but there is little argument over the ambiguous consequences of this comparatively new technology , and numerous critics noted the potential pros and cons of gm crops as soon as they were launched in the early 1990s ( mannion , 1995a , 1995b , 1995c ) .
