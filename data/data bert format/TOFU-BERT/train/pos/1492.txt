statement from the dean of fhs ( faculty of health sciences ) on the vaccine resistance movement event at sfu harbour centre : ' it has recently come to our attention that the " vaccine resistance movement " ( vrm ) has rented space in the sfu harbour centre building to host their summit 2013 conference . downtown sfu space is routinely rented for commercial purposes to community and corporate groups . we are deeply concerned that the public may interpret this as an indication that sfu supports the perspective of the vrm . nothing could be further from the truth . renting downtown campus space does not convey in any way that these events are supported or promoted by sfu . although we believe strongly in free and open debate of public health issues , the faculty of health sciences believes that vrm promotes a dangerous , anti - science message that is a threat to the health of children and communities globally . vaccines are rigorously tested for efficacy and safety and there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the claims of the vrm that vaccines are responsible for autism and other auto - immune conditions .
