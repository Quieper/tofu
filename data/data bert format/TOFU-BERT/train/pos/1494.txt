in contrast , scientific evidence for the effectiveness of large - scale vaccination campaigns is well - established . full vaccination , from birth to adolescence , of all us children born in a given year , saves an estimated 33 , 000 lives and prevents an estimated 14 million infections . lack of complete vaccine coverage increases the risk of disease for the entire population , including those who have been vaccinated . public reaction to vaccine controversies has contributed to a significant increase in preventable diseases including pertussis ( whooping cough ) , which is currently experiencing its worst outbreak in 70 years as a result of reduced vaccination rates . pertussis continues to be a major health problem in developing countries , where mass vaccination is not practiced ; the world health organization estimates it caused 294 , 000 deaths in 2002 .
