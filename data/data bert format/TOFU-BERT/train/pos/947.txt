today , those who directly see the most benefits from gmos are farmers and agricultural companies . as consumers , we probably do not perceive direct benefits to ourselves just by picking the product up off the shelf ( this may change in the future if the nutritional properties of plants are enhanced ) . however , with many gm crops there are secondary benefits that shoppers are unlikely to be aware of by glancing at items in the aisle , such as : lower cost , less soil erosion ( because tillage is not as necessary for weed control ) , less pesticide application and others .
