another form of modified rice was generated to help combat iron deficiency , which impacts close to 30 percent of the world population . this gm crop was engineered by introducing into the rice genome a ferritin gene from the common bean , phaseolus vulgaris , that produces a protein capable of binding iron , as well as a gene from the fungus aspergillus fumigatus that produces an enzyme capable of digesting compounds that increase iron bioavailability via digestion of phytate ( an inhibitor of iron absorption ) . the iron - fortified gm rice was engineered to overexpress an existing rice gene that produces a cysteine - rich metallothioneinlike ( metal - binding ) protein that enhance iron absorption .
