reductions in tillage and pesticide application have great benefits because they minimize inputs of fossil fuels in farming systems and in doing so , they reduce the carbon footprint of crop production ( baker , ochsner , venterea , & griffis , 2007 ) . the mitigation of soil erosion is important with respect to environmental conservation and the conservation of productivity potential . the adoption of no tillage practices would also save on the use of diesel fuel , and it enriches carbon sequestration in soils ( brooke & barfoot , 2014 ) . brooke and barfoot ( 2008 ) suggested that the fuel reduction because of gm crop cultivation resulted in a carbon dioxide emissions savings of 1215 × 106 kg . this corresponds to taking more than 500 , 000 cars off the road . in addition , a further 13 . 5 × 109 kg of carbon dioxide could be saved through carbon sequestration , which is equivalent to taking 6 million cars off the road . the impact of gm crops on the carbon flows in agriculture may be considered as a positive impact of gm crops on the environment ( knox et al . , 2006 ) .
