like many forms of power generation , geothermal is location specific . to further confuse the public , geothermal is a term that is attached to two different forms of energy supply . one form is that of direct heat , where bore holes into the earth at a relatively nominal depth , capitalize on extant heat as a means of providing stable heat source . this heat source can be best used with a system of electrical pumps , where the earth becomes a storehouse of hot and cold air , cycled by electrical pumps to act as an hvac system . in some geographic locations , this set - up has benefits and , depending on the cost of electricity ( to run the pumps that cycle the air ) and depending on the stability and ambient temperature differential fluctuations , this can be a cost - efficient form of heating / cooling .
