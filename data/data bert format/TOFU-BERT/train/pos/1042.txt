simple cycle gas turbine ( scgt ) plants use thermal energy released from the combustion of natural gas to spin a turbine , which in turn drives an electrical generator to produce electricity . scgt plants can be started or stopped quickly in response to changing demand , which makes scgt ideal for peaking plants which are designed to balance supply from intermittent power sources , such as wind . system operators also use scgt sources to protect against unexpected outages at other generating stations and to overcome transmission bottlenecks or constraints .
