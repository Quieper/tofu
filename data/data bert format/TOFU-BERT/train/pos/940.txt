another application of gmos is in the management of environmental issues . for example , some bacteria can produce biodegradable plastics , and the transfer of that ability to microbes that can be easily grown in the laboratory may enable the wide - scale " greening " of the plastics industry . in the early 1990s , zeneca , a british company , developed a microbially produced biodegradable plastic called biopol ( polyhydroxyalkanoate , or pha ) . the plastic was made with the use of a gm bacterium , ralstonia eutropha , to convert glucose and a variety of organic acids into a flexible polymer . gmos endowed with the bacterially encoded ability to metabolize oil and heavy metals may provide efficient bioremediation strategies .
