the heated fluid from a geothermal resource is tapped by drilling wells , sometimes as deep as 9 , 100 metres ( about 30 , 000 feet ) , and is extracted by pumping or by natural artesian flow ( where the weight of the water forces it to the surface ) . water and steam are then piped to the power plant to generate electricity or through insulated pipeline - which may be buried or placed aboveground - for use in heating and cooling applications . in general , electric power plant pipeline are limited to roughly 1 . 6 km ( 1 mile ) in length to minimize heat loss in the steam . however , direct - use pipeline spanning several tens of kilometres have been installed with a temperature loss of less than 2 - 5 ° c ( 3 . 6 - 9 ° f ) , depending on the flow rate . the most economically efficient facilities are located close to the geothermal resource to minimize the expense of constructing long pipeline . in the case of electric power generation , costs can be kept down by locating the facility near electrical transmission lines to transmit the electricity to market .
