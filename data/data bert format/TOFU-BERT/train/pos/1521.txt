comparing the benefits of geothermal energy with other renewable energy sources , the main advantage of geothermal energy is that its base load is available 24 hours per day , 7 days per week , whereas solar and wind are available only about one - third of the time . in addition , the cost of geothermal energy varies between 5 and 10 cents per kilowatt - hour , which can be competitive with other energy sources , such as coal . the main disadvantage of geothermal energy development is the high initial investment cost in constructing the facilities and infrastructure and the high risk of proving the resources . ( geothermal resources in low - permeability rocks are often found , and exploration activities often drill " dry " holes - that is , holes that produce steam in amounts too low to be exploited economically . ) however , once the resource is proven , the annual cost of fuel ( that is , hot water and steam ) is low and tends not to escalate in price .
