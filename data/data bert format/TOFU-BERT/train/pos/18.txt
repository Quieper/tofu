the journey to mass production continues to be in its early stages . scientists have been vocal about the challenges associated with replicating the texture , and flavour of beef from cattle and there continue to be issues surrounding the production of cultured meat in a cost - effective , scalable manner . the very first lab - grown burger , produced in 2013 cost $ 1 . 2 million per pound , with a single burger requiring billions of cells . according to scientists , the very expensive process of cell production will continue to make clean meat cost prohibitive to consumers for at least the next decade , until technology catches up .
