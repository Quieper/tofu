from the late 1990s , the european union ( eu ) addressed such concerns by implementing strict gmo labeling laws . in the early 2000s , all gm foods and gm animal feeds in the eu were required to be labeled if they consisted of or contained gm products in a proportion greater than 0 . 9 percent . by contrast , in the united states , foods containing gm ingredients did not require special labeling , though the issue was hotly debated at national and state levels . many opponents of gm products focused their arguments on unknown risks to food safety . however , despite the concerns of some consumer and health groups , especially in europe , numerous scientific panels , including the u . s . food and drug administration , concluded that consumption of gm foods was safe , even in cases involving gm foods with genetic material from very distantly related organisms .
