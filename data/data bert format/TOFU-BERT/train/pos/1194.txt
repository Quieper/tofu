sahin received his doctorate at the end of may 2016 . now he wants to develop a prototype with the help of an stw demonstrator grant so that the possibilities of the chip can be demonstrated to industry , tells schroen . ' we want to increase the yield by a factor of ten and gain an even better understanding of the process . ' ' in addition , we need to demonstrate that the chip can run 24 / 7 , ' says sahin . ' we have a lot of knowledge about the settings you can tweak to create various sizes and quantities of oil droplets , and now we want to share this knowledge with interested manufacturers . this way , we can advise them about the formulas that they must use to realise a final product with the desired properties . this could be the texture of a cream , the final taste experience of a dressing , or the concentrations of active substances in a medicine , ' he says .
