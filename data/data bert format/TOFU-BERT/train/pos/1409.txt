the earth geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity energy needs , but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited . drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive . forecast for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology , energy prices , subsidies , plate boundary movement and interest rates . pilot programs like eweb customer opt in green power program [ 9 ] show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal . but as a result of government assisted research and industry experience , the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25 % over the 1980s and 1990s . [ 10 ] in 2001 , geothermal energy costs between two and ten us cents per kwh . [ 11 ]
