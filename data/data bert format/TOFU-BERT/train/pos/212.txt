crispr - clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats - is often used as shorthand for the crispr - associated protein 9 ( cas9 ) technology . in the lab it can remove and replace specific sequences of dna . scientists now expect that it will be harnessed to treat and or possibly cure debilitating diseases such as sickle cell anemia , duchenne muscular dystrophy , huntington disease , hiv , and cancers . preclinical studies are underway to assess the safety of crispr - cas9 and its ability to discriminate healthy from non - healthy cells .
