genetically modified organisms ( gmos ) result from recombinant dna technology that allows for dna to be transferred from one organism to another ( transgenesis ) without the genetic transfer limits of species to species barriers and with successful expression of transferred genes in the receiving organism ( gray , 2001 ) . four crops , maize , canola , soybean , and cotton , constitute the vast majority of gm crop production ( james , 2015a ) , and gm crops have been grown commercially since 1995 ( bagavathiannan , julier , barre , gulden , & van acker , 2010 ) . the acceptance of gm crops by farmers has been rapid , with the global gm production area growing from 1 . 7 million hectares in 1996 ( international service for the acquisition of agri - biotech applications [ isa ] , 2015 ) to 182 million hectares in 2014 ( james , 2014 ) . just 10 countries represent almost 98 % of the gm hectares worldwide . the top gm producing countries are the united states ( 73 . 1 million ha ) , brazil ( 42 . 2 million ha ) , argentina ( 24 . 3 million ha ) , canada ( 11 . 6 million ha ) , and india ( 11 . 6 million ha ) ( james , 2014 ) . gm soybean is the most popular gm crop and almost 50 % of global soybean acres are now gm soybean ( james , 2015b ) . for corn and cotton the global proportion of gm is 30 % and 14 % , respectively ( james , 2015b ) . gm canola occupies only 5 % of the global canola hectares ( james , 2015b ) . gm crops are grown on only 3 . 7 % of the world total agricultural land , by less than one percent of the world farmers . almost 100 % of gm crops on the market are either herbicide tolerant ( ht ) or insect resistant or have both of these two traits ( dil , cajacob , & padgette , 2008 ) .
