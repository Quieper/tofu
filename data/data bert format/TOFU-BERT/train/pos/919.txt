pesticides have some negative consequences . they add chemicals to the field that can kill beneficial organisms , they are costly to the farmer and they can be dangerous to certain animals as well as the workers who are applying them . these are some of the reasons why scientists developed genetically modified crops that are pest - resistant . making the plant itself pest - resistant eliminated or greatly diminished the need for pesticide application on many crops .
