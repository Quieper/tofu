depending upon the temperature and the fluid ( steam ) flow , geothermal energy can be used to generate electricity . geothermal power plants can produce electricity in three ways . despite their differences in design , all three control the behaviour of steam and use it to drive electrical generators . given that the excess water vapour at the end of each process is condensed and returned to the ground , where it is reheated for later use , geothermal power is considered a form of renewable energy .
