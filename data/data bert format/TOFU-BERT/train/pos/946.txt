when farmers plant their crops they generally worry about three things that could prevent a good yield : insects , weeds and weather . most of the gm crops grown around the world today address problems caused by insects or weeds ( although some gmos are currently being tested for enhanced nutrition ) . when it comes to insects , there are genetically modified plants that can repel only the very particular type of insect that feeds on it . with some crops , this has significantly lowered the need to apply pesticides . other gm plants have been developed to be resistant to certain herbicides thus making weed control more straightforward and less expensive .
