clean - modern closed - loop geothermal power plants emit no greenhouse gases ; life cycle ghg emissions ( 50 g co2 eq / kwhe ) are four times less than solar pv , and six to 20 times lower than natural gas . geothermal power plants consume less water on average over the lifetime energy output than the most conventional generation technologies . **
