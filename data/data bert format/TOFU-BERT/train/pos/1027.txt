a ground source heat pump takes advantage of the naturally occurring difference between the above - ground air temperature and the subsurface soil temperature to move heat in support of end uses such as space heating , space cooling ( air conditioning ) , and even water heating . a ground source or geoexchange system consists of a heat pump connected to a series of buried pipes . one can install the pipes either in horizontal trenches just below the ground surface or in vertical boreholes that go several hundred feet below ground . the heat pump circulates a heat - conveying fluid , sometimes water , through the pipes to move heat from point to point .
