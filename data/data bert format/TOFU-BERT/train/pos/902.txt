the novelty of gm technology has been both an asset and a challenge for those companies producing gm seeds . supporters of gm crops have asserted that gm is merely an evolution of conventional breeding approaches ( herdt , 2006 ) . they have insisted that humans have been genetically modifying crops for millennia and that gm technology has been an extension and facilitation of natural breeding . at the same time , however , gm crops are patentable , emphasizing that the process is truly novel and different from the natural breeding ( boucher , 1999 ) . in addition , expert technical assessments acknowledge the unique and novel nature of gm crops ( taylor , 2007 ) . this situation highlights the conundrum and challenge of not only introducing disruptive new technologies into society but having such technologies accepted by society ( van acker et al . , 2015 ) . the socioeconomic nature of most risks along with the continuing farm income crisis in north america has led some to argue for the adoption of a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment of gm crops and all new agricultural technologies ( mauro et al . , 2009 ) .
