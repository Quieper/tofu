the thermal efficiency of geothermal electric plants is low , around 10 - 23 % , because geothermal fluids do not reach the high temperatures of steam from boilers . the laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy . exhaust heat is wasted , unless it can be used directly and locally , for example in greenhouse , timber mills , and district heating . system efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel , but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant . in order to produce more energy than the pumps consume , electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles . [ citation needed ] because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy , unlike , for example , wind or solar , its capacity factor can be quite large - up to 96 % has been demonstrated . [ 34 ] the global average was 73 % in 2005 .
