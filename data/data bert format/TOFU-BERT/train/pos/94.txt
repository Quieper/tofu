mechanical advantages : if we think about some other technologies , even green technologies , there is a tendency for some sort of moving part that can fail ; wind turbines provide an excellent example of this . solar panels are different . with no moving parts and absolutely no noise produced by photovoltaics , solar panels are far more silent and less - intrusive than some of the alternatives .
