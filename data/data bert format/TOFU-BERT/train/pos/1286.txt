there are different geothermal technologies with distinct levels of maturity . technologies for direct uses like district heating , geothermal heat pumps , greenhouse , and for other applications are widely used and can be considered mature . the technology for electricity generation from hydrothermal reservoirs with naturally high permeability is also mature and reliable , and has been operating since 1913 . many of the power plants in operation today are dry steam plants or flash plants ( single , double and triple ) harnessing temperatures of more than 180 Â° c . however , medium temperature fields are more and more used for electricity generation or for combined heat and power thanks to the development of binary cycle technology , in which geothermal fluid is used via heat exchangers to heat a process fluid in a closed loop . additionally , new technologies are being developed like enhanced geothermal systems ( egs ) , which are in the demonstration stage .
