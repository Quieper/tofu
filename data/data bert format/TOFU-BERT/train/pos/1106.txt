the uk has some of the best renewable energy sources in the world . our islands , battered by wind and waves , are perfect for tapping into these power sources . even solar energy has a role to play - solar panels are more efficient in direct sunlight , but can generate power even on a cloudy day . new developments in battery storage mean renewable energy can be used even when the wind is not blowing or the sun shining . this provides a fantastic opportunity for the uk to be at the forefront of technological innovation , creating jobs and driving down costs even more .
