in total , electrical plant construction and well drilling cost about 2 - 5 million per mw of electrical capacity , while the break - even price is 0 . 04 - 0 . 10 per kwh . [ 16 ] enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges , with capital costs above $ 4 million per mw and break - even above $ 0 . 054 per kwh in 2007 . [ 41 ] direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures , so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible . residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10 kilowatt ( kw ) are routinely installed for around $ 1 - 3 , 000 per kilowatt . district heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense , as in cities and greenhouse , but otherwise , piping installation dominates capital costs . the capital cost of one such district heating system in bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1 million per mw . [ 42 ] direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs per kwh , but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressor . some governments subsidize geothermal projects .
