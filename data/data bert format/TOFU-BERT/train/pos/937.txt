gmos have emerged as one of the mainstays of biomedical research since the 1980s . for example , gm animal models of human genetic diseases enabled researchers to test novel therapies and to explore the roles of candidate risk factors and modifiers of disease outcome . gm microbes , plants , and animals also revolutionized the production of complex pharmaceuticals by enabling the generation of safer and cheaper vaccines and therapeutic . pharmaceutical products range from recombinant hepatitis b vaccine produced by gm baker yeast to injectable insulin ( for diabetics ) produced in gm escherichia coli bacteria and to factor viii ( for hemophiliacs ) and tissue plasminogen activator ( tpa , for heart attack or stroke patients ) , both of which are produced in gm mammalian cells grown in laboratory culture . furthermore , gm plants that produce " edible vaccines " are under development . an edible vaccine is an antigenic protein that is produced in the consumable parts of a plant ( e . g . , fruit ) and absorbed into the bloodstream when the parts are eaten . once absorbed into the body , the protein stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the pathogen from which the antigen was derived . such vaccines could offer a safe , inexpensive , and painless way to provide vaccines , particularly in less - developed regions of the world , where the limited availability of refrigeration and sterile needles has been problematic for some traditional vaccines . novel dna vaccines may be useful in the struggle to prevent diseases that have proved resistant to traditional vaccination approaches , including hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and cancer .
