ghps have several advantages over more conventional heating and air - conditioning systems . they are very efficient , using 25 - 50 percent less electricity than comparable conventional heating and cooling systems , and they produce less pollution . the reduction in energy use associated with ghps can translate into as much as a 44 percent decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared with air - source heat pumps ( which transfer heat between indoor and outdoor air ) . in addition , when compared with electric resistance heating systems ( which convert electricity to heat ) coupled with standard air - conditioning systems , ghps can produce up to 72 percent less greenhouse gas emissions .
