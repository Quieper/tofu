the amount of usable energy from geothermal sources varies with depth and by extraction method . the increase in temperature of rocks and other materials underground averages 20 - 30 ° c ( 36 - 54 ° f ) per kilometre ( 0 . 6 mile ) depth worldwide in the upper part of the lithosphere , and this rate of increase is much higher in most of earth known geothermal areas . normally , heat extraction requires a fluid ( or steam ) to bring the energy to the surface . locating and developing geothermal resources can be challenging . this is especially true for the high - temperature resources needed for generating electricity . such resources are typically limited to parts of the world characterized by recent volcanic activity or located along plate boundaries or within crustal hot spots . even though there is a continuous source of heat within earth , the extraction rate of the heated fluids and steam can exceed the replenishment rate , and , thus , use of the resource must be managed sustainably .
