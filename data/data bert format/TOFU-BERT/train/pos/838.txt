solar power ( pv ) is generally regarded as the first choice for homeowners looking to become energy producers themselves , but wind turbines make an excellent alternative in some situations . it would take a wind turbine of about 10 kilowatts and $ 40 , 000 to $ 70 , 000 to become a net electricity producer . investments like this typically break even after 10 to 20 years .
