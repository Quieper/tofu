ultimately , it may be fair to say that the net benefit of solar panels outweighs the cost . we will continue to buy consumer electronics anyway , so it is almost useless to argue that solar panels increase overall waste . it is just as important to consider that solar panels last as long as 40 years , and in that in that time they pay for themselves ( in terms of solar energy produced ) many times over . so while there may be a few bad things about solar energy , you are stilling getting an electronic device that produces free , clean power for your home .
