pcs are often coated with a low percentage ( 1 - 3 percent ) of a fatty acid , such as stearic acid , or other organic material , for use in non - aqueous systems . these coating increase the dispersibility of the pc in the polymer or solvent as well as its compatibility with the polymer or solvent , which in turn maximize the performance and efficiency of the pc .
