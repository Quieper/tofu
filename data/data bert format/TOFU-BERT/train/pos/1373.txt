vaccines contain the same antigen ( or parts of antigen ) that cause diseases . for example , measles vaccine contains measles virus . but the antigen in vaccines are either killed , or weakened to the point that they do not cause disease . however , they are strong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity . in other words , a vaccine is a safer substitute for a child first exposure to a disease . the child gets protection without having to get sick . through vaccination , children can develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases that vaccines prevent .
