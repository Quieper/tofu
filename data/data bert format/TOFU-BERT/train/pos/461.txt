the sun goes up , and it goes back down , every day . even with cloudy days , you will still experience enough sunlight to gather enough energy to power your house . and because the sun belongs to everyone in every corner of the globe , it cannot be monopolized . one day , there may be a monopoly on solar energy companies that create panels or sell back energy to utility companies , but you cannot patent the sun . thus , your energy is safe and secure so long as you are able to capture it . you essentially become an independent source of electricity , giving you energy independence !
