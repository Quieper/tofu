the adoption of no tillage and minimum tillage practices in agriculture started in the 1980s . in fact , the largest extension of both no tillage and conservation tillage and the concomitant declines in soil erosion significantly predates the release of the first ht varieties of maize and soybean in 1996 ( national research council [ nrc ] , 2010 ) . however , farmers in the united states who adopted ht crops were more likely to practice conservation tillage and vice versa ( nrc , 2010 . ) there was an increase in ht crops and conservation tillage in the united states during the period of rapid gm crop adoption from 1997 - 2002 ( fernandez - cornejo , hallahan , nehring , wechsler , & grube , 2012 ) . soybeans genetically engineered with ht traits have been the most widely and rapidly adopted gm crop in the united states , followed by ht cotton . adoption of ht soybeans increased from 17 % of u . s . soybean acreage in 1997 to 68 % in 2001 and 93 % in 2010 . planting of ht cotton expanded from about 10 % of u . s . acreage in 1997 to 56 % in 2001 and 78 % in 2010 ( fernandez - cornejo et al . , 2012 ) . some argue that the adoption of gm ht varieties resulted in farmers ' deciding to use conservation tillage , or farmers who were practicing conservation tillage may have adopted gm ht crops more readily ( mauro & mclachlan , 2008 ) . adoption of ht soybean has a positive and highly significant impact on the adoption of conservation tillage in the united states ( carpenter , 2010 ) . technologies that promote conservation tillage practices decrease soil erosion in the long term and fundamentally promote soil conservation ( montogomery , 2007 ) , while reducing nutrient and carbon loss ( brooke & barfoot , 2014 ; giller , witter , corbeels , & pablo , 2009 ; mannion & morse , 2013 ; powlson et al . , 2014 ) . adopting ht soybean has decreased the number of tillage operations between 25 % and 58 % in the united states and in argentina ( carpenter , 2010 ) . the introduction of ht soybean has been cited as an important factor in the rapid increase of no tillage practices in argentina , and the adoption of no tillage practices in this region has allowed for wheat to be double cropped with soybean which has led to a fundamental increase in farm productivity ( trigo , cap , malach , & villareal , 2009 ) . substantial growth in no tillage production linked to the adoption of gm ht crops has also been noted in canada . several authors have reported a positive correlation between the adoption of gm ht canola and the adoption of zero - tillage systems in western canada ( phillips , 2003 ; beckie et al . , 2006 ; kleter et al . , 2007 ) . the no tillage canola production area in western canada increased from 0 . 8 million hectares to 2 . 6 million hectares from 1996 to 2005 . this area covers about half the total canola area in canada ( qaim & traxler , 2005 ) . in addition , tillage passes among farmers growing ht canola in canada dropped by more than 70 % in this same period ( smyth , gusta , belcher , phillips , & castle , 2011 ) . fields planted with ht crops in this region require less tillage between crops to manage weeds ( fawcett & towery , 2003 ; nickson , 2005 ) .
