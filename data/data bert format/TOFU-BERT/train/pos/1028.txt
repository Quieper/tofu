if the ground temperature is warmer than the ambient air temperature , the heat pump can move heat from the ground to the building . the heat pump can also operate in reverse , moving heat from the ambient air in a building into the ground , in effect cooling the building . ground source heat pumps require a small amount of electricity to drive the heating / cooling process . for every unit of electricity used in operating the system , the heat pump can deliver as much as five times the energy from the ground , resulting in a net energy benefit .
