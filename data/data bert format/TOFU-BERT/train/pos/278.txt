besides the reduced financial and health costs , many homeowners also enjoy the idea of producing their own energy instead of depending on big energy companies . some communities will allow you to live completely independent of your local energy provider by purchasing a battery that stores any unused energy . however most homeowners are not able to store excess energy , so they will sell it to a local energy provider who can then resell and redistribute the energy to other homes . on the other hand , those who consume more energy then they produce will pay their energy provider for the remaining amount .
