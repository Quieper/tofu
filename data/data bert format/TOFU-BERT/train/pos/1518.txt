geothermal resources can be exhausted if the rate of heat extraction exceeds the rate of natural heat recharge . normally , geothermal resources can be used for 20 to 30 years ; however , the energy output may decrease with time , making continued development uneconomical . on the other hand , geothermal electric power has been produced continually from the larderello geothermal field since the early 1900s and at the geysers since 1960 . although there has been a decline in both of those fields , this problem has been partially overcome by drilling new wells and by recharging the water supply . at the geysers , electrical capacity declined from 1 , 800 mw to approximately 1 , 000 mw , but about 200 mw of capacity was returned by placing the field under one operator and constructing pipeline to deliver wastewater for recharging the reservoir . projects such as the reykjavik district heating system have been operating since the 1930s with little change in the output , and the oregon institute of technology geothermal heating system has been operating since the 1950s with no change in production . thus , with proper management , geothermal resources can be sustainable for many years , and they can even recover if use is suspended for a period of time .
