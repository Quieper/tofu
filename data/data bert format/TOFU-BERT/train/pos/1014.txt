with that in mind , gmos are living beings that have had their genetic code changed in some way . while conventional breeding , which has been going on for centuries , involves mixing all of the genes from two different sources , producing a gmo is much more targeted . rather than crossing two plants out in the field , they insert a gene or two into individual cells in a lab . yet , as mentioned earlier , gm technology can also be used on microorganisms . for example , bacteria have been genetically modified to produce medicines that can cure diseases or vaccines that prevent them . a commonly used medicine that comes from a genetically modified source is insulin , which is used to treat diabetes , but there are many others .
