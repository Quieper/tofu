geothermal power is considered to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the earth heat content . the earth has an internal heat content of 1031 joules ( 31015 twh ) , approximately 100 billion times the 2010 worldwide annual energy consumption . [ 7 ] about 20 % of this is residual heat from planetary accretion , and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past . [ 3 ] natural heat flows are not in equilibrium , and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales . human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow , often without accelerating it . according to most official descriptions of geothermal energy use , it is currently called renewable and sustainable because it returns an equal volume of water to the area that the heat extraction takes place , but at a somewhat lower temperature . for instance , the water leaving the ground is 300 degrees , and the water returning is 200 degrees , the energy obtained is the difference in heat that is extracted . current research estimates of impact on the heat loss from the earth core are based on a studies done up through 2012 . however , if household and industrial uses of this energy source were to expand dramatically over coming years , based on a diminishing fossil fuel supply and a growing world population which is rapidly industrializing requiring additional energy sources , then the estimates on the impact on the earth cooling rate would need to be re - evaluated .
