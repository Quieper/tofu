below earth crust , there is a layer of hot and molten rock , called magma . heat is continually produced in this layer , mostly from the decay of naturally radioactive materials such as uranium and potassium . the amount of heat within 10 , 000 meters ( about 33 , 000 feet ) of earth surface contains 50 , 000 times more energy than all the oil and natural gas resources in the world .
