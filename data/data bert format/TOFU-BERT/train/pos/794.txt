the cost of installation of the wind turbines is less as compared to that of installing fossil - fueled generators . therefore , wind energy can be described as being a cheap form of energy . for instance , the fossil - fueled systems incur extra costs of purchasing fuel that is used to run the generators , which is not experienced in the wind energy since the turbines generate energy by using wind . moreover , wind energy can be installed in developing countries that lack proper infrastructure because installing wind turbines does not require any complex infrastructure compared to installing coal power plants .
