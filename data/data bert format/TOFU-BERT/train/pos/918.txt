gm crops are sold into a market and are subject to the market in terms of providing a realized value proposition for farmers and value through the food chain in terms of reduced costs of production ( lucht , 2015 ) . currently the gm crops on the market are targeted to farmers and have a value proposition based on economic benefits to farmers via operational benefits ( mauro , mclachlan , & van acker , 2009 ) . due to higher yield and lower production cost of gm crops , farmers will get more economic return and produce more food at affordable prices , which can potentially provide benefits to consumers including the poor ( lucht , 2015 ; lemaux , 2009 ) . the most significant economic benefits attributed to gm crop cultivation have been higher gross margins due to lower costs of pest management for farmers ( klumper & qaim , 2014 ; qaim , 2010 ) . gm varieties have provided a financial benefit for many farmers ( andreasen , 2014 ) . in some regions , gm crops have led to reduced labor costs for farmers ( bennett et al . , 2005 ) . whether gm crops have helped to better feed the poor and alleviate global poverty is not yet proven ( yuan et al . , 2011 ) .
