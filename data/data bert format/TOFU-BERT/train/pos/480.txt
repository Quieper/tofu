or , as carl zimmer explains : " as the crispr region fills with virus dna , it becomes a molecular most - wanted gallery , representing the enemies the microbe has encountered . the microbe can then use this viral dna to turn cas enzymes into precision - guided weapons . the microbe copies the genetic material in each spacer into an rna molecule . cas enzymes then take up one of the rna molecules and cradle it . together , the viral rna and the cas enzymes drift through the cell . if they encounter genetic material from a virus that matches the crispr rna , the rna latches on tightly . the cas enzymes then chop the dna in two , preventing the virus from replicating .
