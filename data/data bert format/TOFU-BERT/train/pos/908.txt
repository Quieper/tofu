there is an expectation widely held by those in agriculture that gm seeds increase yields , or at least protect yield potential . gm crops with resistance to insects and herbicides can substantially simplify crop management and reduce crop losses , leading to increased yields ( pray , jikun huang , hu , & rozelle , 2002 ; pray , nagarajan , huang , hu , & ramaswami , 2011 ; nickson , 2005 ) . gm varieties of soybean , cotton , and maize produced 20 % , 15 % , and 7 % higher yield , respectively , than non - gm varieties ( mannion & morse , 2013 ) . the economic research service ( ers ) of the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) noticed a significant relationship between increased crop yields and increased adoption of herbicide - and pesticide - tolerant gm crop seeds , and the usda reported significantly increased yields when farmers adopted herbicide - tolerant cotton and bt cotton ( usda , 2009 ) . india cultivated a record 11 . 6 million hectares of bt cotton planted by 7 . 7 million small farmers in 2014 , with an adoption rate of 95 % , up from 11 . 0 million hectares in 2013 . the increase from 50 , 000 hectares in 2002 to 11 . 6 million hectares in 2014 represents an unprecedented 230 - fold increase in 13 years ( james , 2014 ) . this rapid adoption has been attributed to the increased yields farmers in this region experienced because of the efficacy of the gm seeds on cotton bollworm and the additional income farmers received as a result ( james , 2014 ; morse & mannion , 2009 ) . similarly , the benefits that were obtained by resource - poor cotton farmers in south africa have led many smallholders in south africa and elsewhere in sub - saharan africa to accept gm cotton ( hillocks , 2009 ) . similar benefits were also obtained by resource - poor farmers growing bt maize in the philippines ( james , 2010 ) .
