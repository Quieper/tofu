this coating contains hundreds of nanodispersed platelets per micron of coating thickness . these platelets form a tortuous path for molecules such as oxygen and aromatic , dramatically increasing the barrier properties of the substrate . nanolok coating form an extremely efficient barrier which can be 100s of times less permeable than the uncoated substrate . in addition , these coating are transparent , thus useful for see - through packaging applications . thin coating are applied , making these coating highly cost - effective : approximately 1 - 2 microns ( 0 . 04 - 0 . 08 mil ) of nanolok coating , for example can replace 12 microns ( 0 . 5 mil ) of evoh to achieve the same level of oxygen barrier .
