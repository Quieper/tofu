gm crops may have a positive influence on human health by reducing exposure to insecticides ( brimner , gallivan , & stephenson , 2005 ; knox , vadakuttu , gordon , lardner , & hicks , 2006 ) and by substantially altering herbicide use patterns toward glyphosate , which is considered to be a relatively benign herbicide in this respect ( munkvold , hellmich , & rice , 1999 ) . however these claims are mostly based on assumption rather than real experimental data . there is generally a lack of public studies on the potential human health impacts of the consumption of food or feed derived from gm crops ( domingo , 2016 ; wolt et al . , 2010 ) and any public work that has been done to date has garnered skepticism and criticism , including , for example , the work by seralini et al . ( 2013 ) . however , the gm crops that are commercialized pass regulatory approval as being safe for human consumption by august competent authorities including the food and drug administration in the united states and the european food safety authority in europe . improvement of gm crops that will have a direct influence on health such as decreased allergens ( chu et al . , 2008 ) , superior levels of protein and carbohydrates ( newell - mcgloughlin , 2008 ) , greater levels of essential amino acids , essential fatty acids , vitamin and minerals including , multivitamin corn ( naqvi et al . , 2009 ; zhu et al . , 2008 ) , and maximum zeaxanthin corn ( naqvi et al . , 2011 ) hold much promise but have yet to be commercialized . malnutrition is very common in developing countries where poor people rely heavily on a single food sources such as rice for their diet ( gomez - galera et al . , 2010 ) . nevertheless , rice does not contain sufficient quantities of all essential nutrients to prevent malnutrition and gm crops may offer means for supplying more nutritional benefits through single food sources such as rice ( white & broadley , 2009 ) . this not only supports people to get the nutrition they require , but also plays a potential role in fighting malnutrition in developing nations ( sakakibara & saito , 2006 ; sauter , poletti , zhang , & gruissem , 2006 ) . golden rice is one the most known examples of a bio - fortified gm crop ( potrykus , 2010 ) . vitamin a deficiency render susceptibility to blindness and affects between 250 , 000 and 500 , 000 children annually and is very common in parts of africa and asia ( golden rice project , 2009 ) . a crop like golden rice could help to overcome the problem of vitamin a deficiency by at least 50 % at moderate expense ( stein , sachdev , & qaim , 2008 ) , yet its adoption has been hampered by activist campaigns ( potrykus , 2012 ) .
