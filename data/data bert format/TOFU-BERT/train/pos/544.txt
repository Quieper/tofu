you do not need the photovoltaic effect to use the sun energy . solar cookers focus and trap sunlight in containers that cook food without using fuel . solar water heaters work by using tubes or panels to collect solar energy that heats the water . companies and utilities that need large amounts of electricity can use solar arrays - structures that consist of interconnected solar arrays . as of march 2015 , nellis air force base , nevada , was working on the department of defense largest pv system . when completed , it will provide the base with 19 megawatts of power . because silicon solar cells only produce energy using the sun visible light , they do not take advantage of the infrared radiation the sun emits .
