estimates of the potential for electricity generation from geothermal energy vary sixfold , from . 035to2tw depending on the scale of investments . [ 7 ] upper estimates of geothermal resources assume enhanced geothermal wells as deep as 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) , whereas existing geothermal wells are rarely more than 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) deep . [ 7 ] wells of this depth are now common in the petroleum industry . the deepest research well in the world , the kola superdeep borehole , is 12 kilometres ( 7 mi ) deep . [ 48 ]
