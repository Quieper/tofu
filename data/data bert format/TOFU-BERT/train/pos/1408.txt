geothermal power is cost - effective , reliable , sustainable , and environmentally friendly , [ 8 ] but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries . recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources , especially for applications such as home heating , opening a potential for widespread exploitation . geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth , but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels .
