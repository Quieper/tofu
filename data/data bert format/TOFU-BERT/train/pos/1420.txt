heating is cost - effective at many more sites than electricity generation . at natural hot springs or geysers , water can be piped directly into radiators . in the hot , dry ground , earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat . however , even in areas where the ground is colder than room temperature , heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost - effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnace . [ 37 ] these devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques . they frequently combine functions , including air conditioning , seasonal thermal energy storage , solar energy collection , and electric heating . heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere .
