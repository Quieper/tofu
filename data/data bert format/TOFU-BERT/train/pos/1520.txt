in addition , ghps have a very minimal effect on the environment , because they make use of shallow geothermal resources within 100 metres ( about 330 feet ) of the surface . ghps cause only small temperature changes to the groundwater or rocks and soil in the ground . in closed - loop systems the ground temperature around the vertical boreholes is slightly increased or decreased ; the direction of the temperature change is governed by whether the system is dominated by heating ( which would be the case in colder regions ) or cooling ( which would be the case in warmer regions ) . with balanced heating and cooling loads , the ground temperatures will remain stable . likewise , open - loop systems using groundwater or lake water would have very little effect on temperature , especially in regions characterized by high groundwater flows .
