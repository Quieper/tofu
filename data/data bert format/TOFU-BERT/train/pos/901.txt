the extensive adaptation of gm crops does , however , also have some drawbacks . the occurrence of outcrossing with non - gm crops , gene flow , and the adventitious presence of gm crops on organic farms has sparked concerns among various stakeholders , including farmers who are growing gm crops ( ellstrand , 2003 ; marvier & van acker , 2005 ) . public concern over gm crops is centered in three areas : human health , environmental safety , and trade impacts ( van acker , cici , michael , ryan , & sachs , 2015 ) . gm biosafety is also forcing both agriculture and food companies to appreciate gm safety in their marketing decisions ( blaine & powell , 2001 ; rotolo et al . , 2015 ) . the adoption of gm crops in a given jurisdiction is a function of public gm acceptance as well as the level of public trust of regulatory authorities ( vigani & olper , 2013 ) . examples of these include feeding the world , consumer choice , and seed ownership ( van acker & cici , 2014 ) . opponents of gm crops have questioned their necessity in terms of agricultural productivity to feed the world ( gilbert , 2013 ) . they point to studies that have shown that current agricultural output far exceeds global calorie needs and that distribution , access , and waste are the key limitations to feeding those who are hungry and not gross production per se ( altieri , 2005 ) .
