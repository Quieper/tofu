vaccination is very safe and effective . vaccines are only given to children after a long and careful review by scientists , doctors , and healthcare professionals . vaccines will involve some discomfort and may cause pain , redness , or tenderness at the site of injection but this is minimal compared to the pain , discomfort , and trauma of the diseases these vaccines prevent . serious side effects following vaccination , such as severe allergic reaction , are very rare . the disease - prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children .
