wind power is cost - effective . land - based utility - scale wind is one of the lowest - priced energy sources available today , costing between two and six cents per kilowatt - hour , depending on the wind resource and the particular project financing . because the electricity from wind farms is sold at a fixed price over a long period of time ( e . g . 20 + years ) and its fuel is free , wind energy mitigates the price uncertainty that fuel costs add to traditional sources of energy .
