polls consistently show that the public really does not like industrial farms . last year , oklahoma state university researchers found that 47 % of those they surveyed want to ban slaughterhouses , and 47 % support banning factory farming . fully 68 % said they had discomfort with the way animals are used in the food industry . once we can offer those 68 % of people the animal meat they want without that discomfort , clean meat will be the obvious choice .
