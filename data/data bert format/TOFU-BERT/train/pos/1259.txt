ground - source heat pumps . a much more conventional way to tap geothermal energy is by using geothermal heat pumps to provide heat and cooling to buildings . also called ground - source heat pumps , they take advantage of the constant year - round temperature of about 50 Â° f that is just a few feet below the ground surface . either air or antifreeze liquid is pumped through pipes that are buried underground , and re - circulated into the building . in the summer , the liquid moves heat from the building into the ground . in the winter , it does the opposite , providing pre - warmed air and water to the heating system of the building .
