the first time a child is infected with a specific antigen ( say measles virus ) , the immune system produces antibodies designed to fight it . this takes time . . . usually the immune system cannot work fast enough to prevent the antigen from causing disease , so the child still gets sick . however , the immune system " remembers " that antigen . if it ever enters the body again , even after many years , the immune system can produce antibodies fast enough to keep it from causing disease a second time . this protection is called immunity .
