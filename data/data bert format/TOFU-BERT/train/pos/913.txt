the reduction of pesticide applications is a major direct benefit of gm crop cultivation : reducing farmers ' exposure to chemicals ( hossain et al . , 2004 ; huang , hu , rozelle , & pray , 2005 ) and lowering pesticide residues in food and feed crops , while also releasing less chemicals into the environment and potentially increasing on - farm diversity in insects and pollinators ( nickson , 2005 ) . additionally , improved pest management can reduce the level of mycotoxins in food and feed crops ( wu , 2006 ) . insect resistance in gm crops has been conferred by transferring the gene for toxin creation from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis ( bt ) into crops like maize . this toxin is naturally occurring in bt and is presently used as a traditional insecticide in agriculture , including certified organic agriculture , and is considered safe to use on food and feed crops ( roh , choi , li , jin , & je , 2007 ) . gm crops that produce this toxin have been shown to require little or no additional pesticide application even when pest pressure is high ( bawa & anilakumar , 2013 ) . as of the end of the 21st century , insect resistant gm crops were available via three systems ( bt variants ) . monsanto and dow agrosciences have developed smartstax maize , which has three pest management attributes , including protection against both above - ground and below - ground insect pest , and herbicide tolerance , which facilitates weed control ( monsanto , 2009 ) . smartstax maize gm varieties were first approved for release in the united states in 2009 and combine traits that were originally intended to be used individually in gm crops ( mannion & morse , 2013 ) . significant reductions in pesticide use is reported by adoption of bt maize in canada , south africa , and spain , as well as bt cotton , notably in china ( pemsl , waibel , & gutierrez , 2005 ) , india ( qiam , 2003 ) , australia , and the united states ( mannion & morse , 2013 ) .
