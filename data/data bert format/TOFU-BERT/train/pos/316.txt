crisprs do not have to be paired with separate " cleaving enzymes " like other methods do , which makes the method simpler to use . it is also easy to match crisprs with guide rna . jennifer doudna , one of the pioneers of crispr , once spoke about a colleague who was attempting to edit genes in mice with talens . several months later , the colleague gave up after failing with seven different enzymes used for targeting . the researcher subsequently used crispr - cas9 , succeeding with all seven targets within three to four weeks .
