in rare cases it makes sense to get a battery backup system . currently adding a battery backup system can add tremendous cost to the solar system ( think $ 10k + ) and does not make sense unless it is crucial . if you choose to have your own battery backup with your system , your system and your battery would be sized so that you are 100 % self - sufficient .
