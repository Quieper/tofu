over the next couple of decades , researchers discovered that bacteria used crispr - associated system ( cas ) proteins to defend against attacks from viruses . these cas proteins actually cut up the dna of viruses as if they were molecular scissors . eventually , scientists learned that crispr did not have to be limited to use by bacteria on viral dna . humans could also use crispr to edit the genes of any living organism .
