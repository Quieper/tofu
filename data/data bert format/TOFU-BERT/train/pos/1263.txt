the costs for electricity from geothermal facilities are also becoming increasingly competitive . the u . s . energy information administration ( eia ) projected that the levelized cost of energy ( lcoe ) for new geothermal plants ( coming online in 2019 ) will be less than 5 cents per kilowatt hour ( kwh ) , as opposed to more than 6 cents for new natural gas plants and more than 9 cents for new conventional coal [ 12 ] . there is also a bright future for the direct use of geothermal resources as a heating source for homes and businesses in any location .
