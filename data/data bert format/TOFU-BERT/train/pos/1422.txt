enhanced geothermal systems ( egs ) actively inject water into wells to be heated and pumped back out . the water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out . the technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques . however , the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used , reducing the possibility of environmental damage . drillers can employ directional drilling to expand the size of the reservoir .
