seismically active hotspots are not the only places where geothermal energy can be found . there is a steady supply of milder heat - useful for direct heating purposes - at depths of anywhere from 10 to a few hundred feet below the surface virtually in any location on earth . even the ground below your own backyard or local school has enough heat to control the climate in your home or other buildings in the community . in addition , there is a vast amount of heat energy available from dry rock formations very deep below the surface ( 4 - 10 km ) . using the emerging technology known as enhanced geothermal systems ( egs ) , we may be able to capture this heat for electricity production on a much larger scale than conventional technologies currently allow . while still primarily in the development phase , the first demonstration egs projects provided electricity to grid in the united states and australia in 2013 .
