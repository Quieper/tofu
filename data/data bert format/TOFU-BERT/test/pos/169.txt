tracking global no levels from space also provides a measure of how covid - 19 is impacting industrial and economic activity . the no in our air is almost entirely from combustion . when coal and wood burn , nitrogen trapped in the fuel is oxidised as no . cars and trucks make no in their engines when they break down nitrogen in the air at extremely high temperatures . a drop in atmospheric no therefore tells us that fuel burning has decreased .
