toxicity is a becoming a health crisis . we ingest new chemicals , use more medication , eat more sugar and refined foods and abuse ourselves daily with various stimulants or sedatives . the incidence of many toxicity induced diseases has increased as well . many people suffer from ongoing fatigue , bloating , headache , pain , skin irritation and constant cold and cough . most conventional doctors would look only for disease , and if the patient tests come back negative , the doctor says nothing is wrong . we investigate this further by recommended environmental testing to patients .
