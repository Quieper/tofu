our mental health system is deeply flawed and understaffed and is in no way prepared to manage the onslaught of mental health issues in health care providers and the citizenry in general after such a mass tragedy . we must think about ways to prevent mental health from deteriorating while also coming up with innovative ways to target at risk groups , particularly health care workers . my friends and family , and the people who are saving lives , cannot afford for us to wait . they could die from the virus , or even from suicide . mental health cannot be an afterthought in coping with a pandemic .
