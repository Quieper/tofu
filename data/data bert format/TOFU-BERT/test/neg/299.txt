health care workers are also concerned they might die from covid - 19 . some health care workers are using words like betrayal and coercion and moral injury to describe this experience . they feel betrayed by their employers , the health care system , and the government , all of which were woefully unprepared for a pandemic and then chose to ignore their warnings . some are concerned they will be called upon to do work they have not done in years due to staffing needs . even still , others are grieving the trauma they will see and the decisions they will be forced to make . some have said even they will simply not come to work and would rather quit medicine all together .
