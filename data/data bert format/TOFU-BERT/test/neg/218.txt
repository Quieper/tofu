in 2009 , a network of scientists assembled by the uk charity sense about science contacted the manufacturers of 15 products sold in pharmacies and supermarkets that claimed to detoxify . the products ranged from dietary supplements to smoothies and shampoos . when the scientists asked for evidence behind the claims , not one of the manufacturers could define what they meant by detoxification , let alone name the toxin . yet , inexplicably , the shelves of health food stores are still packed with products bearing the word " detox " - it is the marketing equivalent of drawing go - faster stripes on your car . you can buy detoxifying tablets , tinctures , tea bags , face masks , bath salts , hair brushes , shampoos , body gels and even hair straighteners . yoga , luxury retreat , and massage will also all erroneously promise to detoxify . you can go on a seven - day detox diet and you will probably lose weight , but that is nothing to do with toxin , it is because you would have starved yourself for a week .
