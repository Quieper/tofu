the literature indicates that oil and gas activities produce noise at levels that may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes , including annoyance , sleep disturbance , and cardiovascular disease . more studies that investigate the relationships between noise exposure and human health risks from unconventional oil and gas development are warranted . finally , policies and mitigation techniques that limit human exposure to noise from oil and gas operations should be considered to reduce health risks .
