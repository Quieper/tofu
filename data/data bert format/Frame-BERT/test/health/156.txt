the potential is manifold , particularly in stabilising foods and enhancing their nutritional properties . for example , if you squeeze an orange and drink it now , you will get vitamin c from it , but if you leave it a while , all the vitamin c will vanish . putting the vitamin c in nanocapsules can allow it to be released only when it is drunk . " and ( it could be useful in ) stabilising nutrients in food . for example , iron and essential fats such as omega - 3 do not remain stable in liquids ; they oxidise and that changes the colour , odour , the taste of the product . . . you could use nanotechnology to stabilise the nutritional properties of products and that would be of benefit to people with deficiencies - anaemia , for example . " food companies , he says , are also excited by the prospect of intelligent packaging and the ability to give foods a longer shelf life . " in africa , there is food , but part of the issue is bringing it to the table and increasing its nutrition profile to give children a better start . stabilisation of nutrients and enabling longer shelf life are areas of development that can reduce suffering .
