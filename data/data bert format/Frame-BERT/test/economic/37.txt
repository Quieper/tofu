the visionary inventor buckminster fuller once said , " i just invent , then wait until man comes around to needing what i have invented . " some existing technologies , such as horizontal drilling , " wait around " until a new generation of innovators recognize their intrinsic value and adapt it for current needs . after being first used in the 1920s , horizontal drilling became one of chevron major tools in the 1980s and today , it is being used more innovatively and yielding outstanding results . from the waters of the north sea to shale formations in the united states , horizontal drilling helps us recover up to 10 times the resources from existing fields .
