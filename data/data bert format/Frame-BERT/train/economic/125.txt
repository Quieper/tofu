Another important con is that wind turbines can only be installed in specific areas which very often happen to be remote from where most people live. Although there are ways to transport wind energy they do require an extra expense. And this takes us to the final disadvantage. Wind turbines are expensive to install and maintain. So this kind of energy source requires large initial investments that not everyone can afford.
