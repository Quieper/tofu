Energy suppliers can build their wind turbines on pre-existing farmland and pay the farm owners to build on their property in the form of contracts or leases. This is a great boon to farmers who can use some extra income, and it wind turbine footprints take up very little space at the ground level, so it doesn’t disrupt their farm’s production. At present, less than 1.5% of contiguous U.S. land area is used by wind power plants. However, given all the plains and cattleland available on the interior of the country, there’s a lot of opportunity for expansion if landowners and government land managers are up for it.[3]
