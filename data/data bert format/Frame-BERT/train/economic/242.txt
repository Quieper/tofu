The EDGE (Edge-based Droplet GEneration) chip created by professor Karin Schroën and PhD student Sami Sahin is technically a thick sieve, they explain. ‘The chip is made up of several layers of microchannels. For a modest production volume, we can produce twenty cubic metres of product per hour for oil percentages of up to thirty percent,’ says the PhD student. ‘And we have demonstrated that it is possible to make oil droplets that are all exactly ten micrometres in size.’ With the EDGE chip, you can even calibrate the size of the droplets.
