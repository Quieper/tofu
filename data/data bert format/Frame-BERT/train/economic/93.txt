Solar modules appear in diverse areas on Earth and above it; satellites and the International Space Station rely on them. Home builders may place photovoltaic cells in construction materials to help buildings generate electricity. Remote locations make ideal candidates for solar energy consumption. Oil and gas companies, for example, power wells and field equipment using light from the sun. In the oceans and waterways, you'll find lighthouses and buoys that use solar energy for power.
