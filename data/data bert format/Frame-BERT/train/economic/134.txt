WETO then selected the project for participation in the DOE Energy I-Corps and Technology Commercialization Fund programs, which accelerate the commercial deployment of national lab-developed technologies by helping build industry partnerships and bring prototypes to market. Energy I-Corps industry mentor and offshore wind developer Trident Winds helped identify developersâ€™ performance parameters and cost requirements related to floating wind systems and pathways to commercialization.
