Where you choose to install the solar system – in terms of the angle on your building and your geographical location in the U.S. – is also an important consideration. Research has found that south-facing solar panels are the most productive because sunlight can directly hit the panels for most of the day. You should also consider the weather of your home state. If you live in Seattle where direct sunlight is quite limited, solar might not be worth the investment.
