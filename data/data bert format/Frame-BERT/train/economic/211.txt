On Oct. 16, 2018, Kosciusko County adopted the safest wind ordinance in the state!Â Kosciusko County Commissioners unanimously approved a new wind ordinance including 3,960 ft. setbacks to property lines, zero shadow flicker on non-participants, 32 dBA at property lines, pre and post construction well inspections, property value guarantees for everyone living within two miles of a turbine, property owners within five miles of the project must be notified by the wind company of the project prior to the company getting leases signed and industrial wind turbines are only permitted in heavy industrial zones - because they are not agricultural!
