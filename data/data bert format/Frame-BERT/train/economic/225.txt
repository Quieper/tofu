Development of the offshore wind resource is at an early stage along California’s Pacific Coast. Offshore wind turbines that are fixed to the ocean floor have been deployed in shallow waters on the East Coast and in Europe. Because the Pacific Coast waters are much deeper, turbines must be mounted on floating platforms that are tethered to the ocean floor. The technologies required to access powerful Pacific winds have recently become available, and project developers are interested to start planning the first offshore wind farms on the West Coast.
