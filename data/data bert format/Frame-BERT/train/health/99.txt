 3.      Recycling – What happens when solar panels break or are decommissioned?  Although solar panel recycling has not become a major issue yet, it will in the coming decades as solar panels need to be replaced.  When solar panels break, it is possible they may leak chemicals which are sealed in a functional module.  If solar panels are not disposed of properly, chemical leaking may be a more widespread issue.  These issues are exacerbated in poorer countries that don’t have as robust of recycling infrastructure as North America or Europe.
