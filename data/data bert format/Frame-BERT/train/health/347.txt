In Fulton County, a local citizens group opposing a proposed commercial wind farm chalked up another win. “Two of three Fulton County Commissioners, Bryan Lewis and Rick Ranstead, signed a pledge stating that as long as they hold public office they will not allow commercial wind turbines in the county. Commissioner Steve Metzger, who recused himself from voting on wind related issues due to perceived conflicts of interest, refused to sign, saying he wasn’t interested.”
