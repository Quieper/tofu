My recent collision with mainstream media outlets provided a fascinating glimpse into the world behind the lens; where-in so called modern journalism now involves the coveting of misleading sound-bytes and “off the cuff” distorted rhetoric, while strategically editing out crucial material in order to support a pre-scripted slant or bias, employing loaded questions posed under pressure, designed to polarize issues, to the exclusion of balanced debate & enlightened, critical thinking type discussion – all of which reveals a growing disconnect between the dissemination of that which constitutes real news and the perpetuation of Western Medical Establishment & Vaccine lobby propaganda.
