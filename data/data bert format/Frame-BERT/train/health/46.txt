    Detox diets lack critical nutrients. Your body needs a combination of fat, protein and carbohydrates to function properly. Going on a liquid diet, such as a juice cleanse, will starve your body of essential nutrients. It can also cause your metabolism to slow down. This is exactly the opposite of what you want when you are trying to lose weight.
