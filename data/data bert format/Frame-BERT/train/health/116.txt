That might seem like a huge leap of the imagination, considering that there are over 6,000 diseases caused by genetic mutations impacting more than 430,000 newborns each year. But one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of our generation -- gene editing -- holds the potential to usher in a world without genetic diseases. And an approach for gene editing discovered only six years ago, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), could be the key for making it happen.
