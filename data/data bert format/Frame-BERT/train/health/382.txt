Geothermal energy is heat derived within the sub-surface of the earth. Water and/or steam carry the geothermal energy to the Earthâ€™s surface. Depending on its characteristics, geothermal energy can be used for heating and cooling purposes or be harnessed to generate clean electricity. However, for electricity, generation high or medium temperature resources are needed, which are usually located close to tectonically active regions.
