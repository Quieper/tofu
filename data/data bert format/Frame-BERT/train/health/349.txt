Concerned Posey County citizens have formed a group called Posey County Citizens for Property Rights and are working hard to educate their neighbors about the detriments of E.ON's proposed industrial wind turbines in Posey County. They are joining with Gibson County friends and neighbors to challenge E.ON's project which is reportedly to span Posey, Gibson and part of Vanderburgh County in southern Indiana. This proves that no rural community is safe from industrial wind turbines. It was believed for many years that wind companies would not target southern Indiana due to the poor wind speeds, but we know that if wind companies can build wind turbines higher, they will put them almost anywhere that rural citizens won't fight back and defend their property rights.
