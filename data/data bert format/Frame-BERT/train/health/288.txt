How do you make a crop pest-resistant? Scientists were able to modify the plant’s protein manufacturing system so that it now makes a protein that wasn’t previously present. This carefully selected protein is one that is toxic to certain insects. Basically, they eat it and their stomach ruptures. This protein is so specifically targeted towards certain pests that it doesn’t affect other insects, animals or humans that eat it. In fact, it is so specific that it doesn’t even impact "good" bugs, like bees or butterflies.
