To meet the requirements of the Non-GMO Project Standard, an input or ingredient derived from a testable major high-risk crop will need test results from the raw source material to prove that it is non-GMO. For example, in order to prove that soy lecithin meets the standard, the raw soy must be tested before it is processed into lecithin.
