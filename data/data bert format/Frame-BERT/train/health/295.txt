If you want to stay away from GMOs, eat only fresh, whole, unprocessed foods marked "certified organic" or "USDA organic." That's how MacDonald shops. But the makers of these foods tag them on the honor system, and they're not checked by the government. And it's OK for these claims to appear on foods developed from genes originally altered by chemicals or radiation.
