    Drinking too much liquid can be dangerous. There is no medical evidence that drinking excess fluids helps the body “flush out” toxins. In fact, if you drink too much water, it can interfere with the ability of your kidneys to properly balance the electrolytes in your body, which regulate nerve and muscle function. This can cause very dangerous problems including cardiac arrhythmias.
