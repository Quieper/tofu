When it comes to green energy, geothermal energy is one of the first types that is being explored. New innovations are coming out for it all of the time, which means that it will likely be easier to deal with some of the difficulties with the technology as time goes on. It can also be manufactured underground. New innovations that are coming out are basically guaranteed to be able to use lower temperatures in future iterations of the technology as well.
