Resistance to specific herbicides is one of the major traits introduced into genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. This has been done to provide new tools to manage and control weeds in fields of crop plants. Farmers can spray the whole field, but only the weeds will die. The crop will continue to grow without competition from weeds.
