Animal agriculture is an inordinate contributor to climate change. United Nations scientists have written that animal agriculture contributes about 40 percent more to climate change than all of the planes, trucks, cars, and other forms of transportation combined. Scientists from the World Bank and International Finance Corporation, writing for the Worldwatch Institute, dispute the U.N.'s findings and argue that the number is actually much higher.
