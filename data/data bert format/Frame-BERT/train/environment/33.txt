SpiderFLOATâ€™s modularization and simplified mooring allow for partial on-site manufacturing and easy towing of the entire system for installation and maintenance. In addition, by minimizing construction activities at the installation site, SpiderFLOAT helps reduce pile driving and other environmentally sensitive activities typically associated with fixed-bottom installations.
