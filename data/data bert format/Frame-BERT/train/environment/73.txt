Existing geothermal electric plants emit an average of 122 kilograms (269 lb) of CO2 per megawatt-hour (MWÂ·h) of electricity, a small fraction of the emission intensity of conventional fossil fuel plants.[54] Plants that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are usually equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust.
