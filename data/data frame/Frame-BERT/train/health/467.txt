This sentiment was echoed by a (semi-mainstream) journalist who interviewed me extensively in March; as a lead-up to our highly controversial VRM Vaccine Summit. He subsequently admitted that there, were, indeed, forces behind the scenes, imposing pressure upon mainstream media outlets (such as his own) to suppress our overall message from getting out. He alluded to the fact that he was on our side, but that, as a journalist, his hands were tied by his higher-ups, and therefore he couldn’t present a more balanced, informative report – the implication being that his directive, was, in fact, to discredit the anti-vaccine movement and deflect attention away from any meaningful discourse.
