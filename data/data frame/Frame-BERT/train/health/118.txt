But fast-forward to March 2018. The research team that wrote the article that was critical of CRISPR-Cas9 did an about-face. They retracted the original article and published a corrigendum (error correction) on scientific website bioRxiv (pronounced "bioarchive"). In their correction, the researchers stated that "CRISPR-Cas9 editing can precisely edit the genome at the organismal level and may not introduce numerous, unintended, off-target mutations." The problems with CRISPR-Cas9 alleged initially turned out to be much ado about nothing.
