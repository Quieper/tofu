Many of today's GM crops have been engineered to be resistant to weed killers, and this has led to an overreliance on these chemicals, Landrigan and  Benbrook said. The authors argued that because some studies have linked cancer risk to the herbicides used on GM crops — in particular, a widely used herbicide called glyphosate (sold under the brand name Roundup) — the United States should reconsider creating labeling requirements for GM foods.
