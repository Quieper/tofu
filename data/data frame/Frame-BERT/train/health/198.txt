Before that, though, some background: CRISPR is a molecule that can be programmed to target a specific sequence in a genome. It guides an enzyme, such as Cas9, to chop the code like tiny molecular scissors. Scientists began using Cas9 to cause “blunt end” breaks in DNA. This tends to initiate a jerry-rigged repair; the break is cobbled back together, incorporating small bits of available DNA or a repair template of other genetic material that scientists might add. A Cas9 repair is not always precise, but as the old saying goes, “a carpenter doesn’t blame his tools.” But researchers have since found Cpf1, another such enzyme, which hacks into double-stranded DNA and leaves a “sticky end” break that leaves one strand dangling off the end. This template allows for more precise gene edits. And in December, U.C. Berkeley scientists reported discovering yet more enzymes—CasX and CasY—which promise to make the technology even more versatile and exacting. In short, technical limitations are evaporating.
