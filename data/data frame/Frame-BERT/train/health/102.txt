Doudna explained how her current research is refining CRISPR–Cas9 to improve its efficiency and prevent off-target mutations. Her laboratory has developed a CRISPR–Cas9 targeted gene knockdown method with enhanced efficiency. This method employs techniques such as single-particle electron microscopy to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the highly diverse CRISPR-Cas networks.
