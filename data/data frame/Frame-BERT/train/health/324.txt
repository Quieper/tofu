A Phase I clinical trial, like this one, usually only includes a handful of patients, according to the American Cancer Society.

Phase I trials don't address whether a drug actually works to treat a condition â€” that question crops up in later trials. As it stands, the CRISPR study suggests that the new cancer therapy is at least safe for three people, barring more data to come.
