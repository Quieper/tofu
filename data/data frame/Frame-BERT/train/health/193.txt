CRISPR is also emerging as an effective means to store data within DNA. In March 2017, a pair of researchers at the New York Genome Centre published a report in the Science journal, detailing methods for storing compressed files in DNA molecules.  With the help of an algorithm for translating the files into a binary code that can be mapped onto the DNA’s nucleotide bases, the researchers were able to encode the total of six files: a 1948 academic paper, a Pioneer plaque, an operating system, a virus, the 1895 film L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat…and a $50 Amazon giftcard.
