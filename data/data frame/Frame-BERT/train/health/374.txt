We furnish all-round solutions, often as turnkey projects including engineering, procurement, and construction in order to assume full responsibility for entire projects for our clients. We focus on Balance of Plant contracts (BoP, all supporting components and auxiliary systems other than the wind turbines) and on transport and installation (T&I) projects.
