First of all, seven out of these ten states either outlaw or don’t clearly state the legal status of third party ownership for solar panels. Third party ownership basically means that home owners let a company install the panels on their house and then sign a contract or lease to pay them for the electricity. This setup occurs in 72 percent of residential solar installations, so when it’s gone, so are people’s chances of solar energy when they don’t have thousands of dollars lying around. States like Alabama also lack policies promoting solar energy or mandates to expand their state’s clean energy supply.
