“Many parents and caregivers have to feed their children formula,” explains Kendra Klein, PhD, staff scientist at Food & Technology Program at Friends of the Earth. “It is reprehensible that companies like Gerber can expose babies to poorly studied, virtually unregulated and unlabeled nanomaterials in infant formula. Suitable alternative ingredients have been used for decades that don’t carry the same risks. We are calling for an immediate moratorium on the use of nanomaterials in formula and other food until they can be demonstrated to be safe and are regulated and labeled. Formula companies must commit to not use these materials right now.”
