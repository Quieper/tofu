The map was started 5 years ago - and the threat identified then has largely materialised. There is now a new threat of single turbines which can be up to 300 feet high. But wind farms and turbines are now being refused locally and these decisions are being upheld at appeal. Two wind farms at Spaldington were refused at appeal, as was a single turbine at Wistow Lordship. It takes a lot of effort but these results show that wind farm applications can be defeated by determined effort by village communities. The process is helped when appeals are called in by the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles.
