As if consuming the maximum dosage of senna weren’t enough, teatoxes are also branded as “movements” to join indefinitely instead of one-time cleanses. “Join the movement and start feeling Boo-Tea-Ful,” writes Bootea on their website. With the movement mentality these companies promote, it’s easy to see how teatox companies provide ample encouragement for prolonged and repeated senna use, and end up walking dangerously close to the line of maximum recommended dosage, if they don’t cross over entirely.
