Picture CRISPR-Cas9 as like a “find and replace” search in a computer document, only instead of words, you’re editing genetic sequences. Accurately modifying DNA is a scientific holy grail, and the potential is enormous. It could be used to eradicate diseases – even hereditary ones such as cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia and Huntington's could become a thing of the past.
