It has been suggested that cultured meat is livestock agriculture’s lab-based response to the vertical farming movement. Meat is “grown” from animal muscle cells through tissue culture in controlled laboratory conditions. These are then combined with fat cells and additives for texture, flavour and colour. The cell-to-fork process takes two to six weeks.
