The area was previously grazed by cattle as the Crescent Peak Allotment. This allotment was closed to protect desert tortoise and desert bighorn sheep through the Clark County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan. The historic Walking Box Ranch was purchased by conservation funds and is now in the process of becoming a BLM visitor contact station.
