By 2020 the Netherlands must have an onshore wind capacity of 6,000 MW. This is set out in theÂ Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth. This means capacity must be increased by over 3,000 MW. An average wind turbine has a capacity of 2 to 3 MW, so the Netherlands needs roughly 1,000 to 1,500 new onshore wind turbines.
