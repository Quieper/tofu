The VRM has based their claim of a link between vaccines and autism on a paper published in 1998 in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, by Andrew Wakefield. It later emerged that Wakefield had received funding from litigants against vaccine manufacturers and that Wakefield had not informed colleagues or medical authorities of his conflict of interest. Had this been known, publication in The Lancet would not have taken place. A 2011 article in the British Medical Journal concluded that the data in the Wakefield study had been falsified. An accompanying editorial in the same journal described Wakefield’s work as an “elaborate fraud” which led to lower vaccination rates, putting hundreds of thousands of children at risk and diverting energy and money away from research into the true cause of autism.
