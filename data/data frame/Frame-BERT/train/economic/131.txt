The new scalable offshore floating wind system, named “SpiderFLOAT” for its modular components that resemble spider legs, is designed to substantially reduce expenses for deepwater substructures, driving down the cost of deepwater wind energy. Ultimately, researchers hope this could make deepwater systems competitive with fixed-bottom offshore wind power plants.
