The wide distribution and adoption of cultured meat wonâ€™t affect all farming economies equally, but the two on stage could be particularly impacted. Both New Zealand and Wales are heavily grass-based farming economies (much like Ireland). Since the countries get plenty of rain, and the grass grows without much effort, farmers have traditionally focused on dairy and forage. Both countries also have relatively small populations and therefore depend on exports. Both are also able to charge a premium for the products derived from the quality of their largely pastured cows and sheep.
