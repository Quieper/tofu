Animal derivatives such as meat, eggs, milk, and honey are considered high-risk inputs due to the prevalence of GMOs in animal feed. As such, animal derivatives are evaluated by reviewing the animalsâ€™ feed, and more specifically, by testing the testable major high-risk inputs to that feed. Cloned animals and their progeny are considered GMOs under the Standard, and are prohibited for use in Verified products.
