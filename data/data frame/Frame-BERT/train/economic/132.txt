Designed as a support platform for wind turbines ranging from 6 to more than 20 MW, SpiderFLOATâ€™s radical new approach could enable high-volume manufacturing and overcome transportation constraints that might otherwise lead to design compromises. SpiderFLOAT is also designed to reduce material content and related substructure costs, while its simplification of routine maintenance requirements supports lower operation and maintenance costs.
