Another obstacle to solar electricity is photovoltaic efficiency. If you live in the desert, a single square meter of solar panel could receive the equivalent of more than 6 kilowatt-hours of energy in the course of a single day. But a solar panel cannot convert that entire amount of energy to electricity. The efficiency of a solar panel determines how much of that power is usable, and most commercial solar panels on the market in 2013 have efficiency ratings of less than 25 percent. The more efficient a panel is, the more expensive it is to produce. Barring any major leaps in technology, efficiency ratings beyond 33 percent are unlikely in the near future.
