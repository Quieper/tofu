Another limiting factor of solar energy is the space panels require. In order to make solar energy worth the cost of production and installation, you need to make sure there is enough room for your system to run efficiently. Typically, a solar installation on a residential home features around 20 solar panels or 300 total square feet, which you can picture as five cars lined up. If you want to cover 100 percent of your home’s energy needs, you’ll probably need even more panels than that – around 28 to 34.
