So this Global Wind Day, we want to emphasize the importance of you, because we recognize the significant role of communities and the immense contributions you make to the renewable energy industry. At Prowind, we strive to offer opportunities for local ownership of renewable energy facilities, which allows communities to become closely involved in sustainable development in their own backyards.
