horizontal drilling is helping to enhance production and recovery from old oil fields . at the century - old kern river field in california san joaquin valley , horizontal wells drilled with steerable tools allow us to effectively access remaining oil , achieving higher production rates and greater recovery than vertical wells . elsewhere in the san joaquin valley , horizontal drilling is achieving similar results . a good example is the san ardo field , where horizontal drilling is enabling us to increase production by improving drainage from the heated portions of a much thicker reservoir .
