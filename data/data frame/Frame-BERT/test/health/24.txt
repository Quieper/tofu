the johns hopkins bloomberg study collected health data from 7 , 785 adults in north and central pennsylvania - some from areas of very active fracking , others not . specifically - and without mentioning anything about fracking - the researchers zeroed in on patients with nasal and sinus problems , migraines , and / or high levels of fatigue , all previously linked to toxic chemicals , irritation , odor , or stress . they then selected a group of participants who did not have these conditions , and used publicly available data on pennsylvania 8 , 800 fracked wells to determine their degree of exposure to the industry . the result : those closest to fracking operations had " significantly increased odds " of a combination of the targeted health effects , suggesting " a threshold in the relationship between [ fracking ] and symptoms . " the researchers point out that the mechanism by which fracking could cause these symptoms has already been established : " exposure to allergens , toxicants , and secondhand smoke may trigger nasal and sinus symptoms . . . migraines can be triggered by noise , odor , and stress . . . similarly , fatigue has multiple risk factors including sleep deprivation , psychosocial stressors . . . and exposure to low levels of environmental chemicals " . " these three health conditions can have debilitating effects on people lives , " says aaron w . tustin , the study first author . " in addition , they cost the health care system a lot of money . our data suggest these symptoms are associated with proximity to the fracking industry . "
