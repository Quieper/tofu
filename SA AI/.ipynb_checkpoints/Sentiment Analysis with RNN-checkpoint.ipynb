      "The United States shale gas boom has precipitated global interest in the development of unconventional oil and gas resources. Recently, government ministers in the United Kingdom started granting licenses that will enable companies to begin initial exploration for shale gas. Meanwhile, concern is increasing among the scientific community about the potential impacts of shale gas and other types of unconventional natural gas development (UGD) on human health and the environment. Although significant data gaps remain, there has been a surge in the number of articles appearing in the scientific literature, nearly three-quarters of which has been published since the beginning of 2013. Important lessons can be drawn from the UGD experience in the United States. Here we explore these considerations and argue that shale gas development policies in the UK and elsewhere should be informed by empirical evidence generated on environmental, public health, and social risks. Additionally, policy decisions should take into account the measured effectiveness of harm reduction strategies as opposed to hypothetical scenarios and purported best practices that lack empirical support.\n",

      "The proposed 32,000-acre Crescent Wind Protect would have had up to 240 giant wind turbine generators on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in southern Nevada along the California border. After making several field visits, WWP wrote detailed comments and attended public meetings to oppose the Crescent Peak Wind Project along with Basin and Range Watch (BRW). Attorney Dave Becker gave input to our comment letter. A large coalition of conservation groups, tribes, and local individuals opposed this project. Our letter emphasized the beautiful visual resources of the area, which lies between Wee Thump Joshua Tree Wilderness Area, the South McCullough Wilderness Area, and three national park units: Mojave National Preserve, Castle Mountains National Monument, and Mojave Trails National Monument. Our comments also emphasized the extremely high biological resources present here. WWP and BRW hosted a weekend Bioblitz for the public to gather observations of the diverse plant and animal species in the area. Nevada Department of Wildlife biologists came to the bioblitz and surveyed for Gila monsters, which may inhabit these desert grasslands. Golden eagles nest in the cliffs of the Castle Peak Mountains here, where wind turbines were proposed.\n",
      "The area was previously grazed by cattle as the Crescent Peak Allotment. This allotment was closed to protect desert tortoise and desert bighorn sheep through the Clark County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan. The historic Walking Box Ranch was purchased by conservation funds and is now in the process of becoming a BLM visitor contact station.\n",
      "The Right-of-Way was canceled by the Department of the Interior, based on high resources values. These extensive Joshua tree woodlands and rich Mojave desert grasslands that have been recovering from livestock grazing, will now be better protected from new roads and energy project development. But the area still needs a higher level of protection, such as designation as an Area of Critical Environmental Concerns. WWP, BRW, and other conservation groups are continuing to work towards that goal.\n",

      "﻿The Basics of wind energy\n",
      "What is wind energy?\n",
      "Wind energy (or wind power) refers to the process of creating electricity using the wind, or air flows that occur naturally in the earth’s atmosphere. Modern wind turbines are used to capture kinetic energy from the wind and generate electricity.\n",
      "There are three main types of wind energy:\n",
      "    • Utility-scale wind: Wind turbines that range in size from 100 kilowatts to several megawatts, where the electricity is delivered to the power grid and distributed to the end user by electric utilities or power system operators.\n",
      "    • Distributed or \"small\" wind:  Single small wind turbines below 100 kilowatts that are used to directly power a home, farm or small business and are not connected to the grid.\n",
      "    • Offshore wind: Wind turbines that are erected in large bodies of water, usually on the continental shelf. Offshore wind turbines are larger than land-based turbines and can generate more power.\n",
      "How wind turbines work\n",
      "When the wind blows past a wind turbine, its blades capture the wind’s kinetic energy and rotate, turning it into mechanical energy. This rotation turns an internal shaft connected to a gearbox, which increases the speed of rotation by a factor of 100. That spins a generator that produces electricity.\n",
      "Typically standing at least 80 meters (262 feet) tall, tubular steel towers support a hub with three attached blades and a “nacelle,” which houses the shaft, gearbox, generator, and controls. Wind measurements are collected, which direct the turbine to rotate and face the strongest wind, and the angle or \"pitch\" of its blades is optimized to capture energy.\n",
      "A typical modern turbine will start to generate electricity when wind speeds reach six to nine miles per hour (mph), known as the cut-in speed. Turbines will shut down if the wind is blowing too hard (roughly 55 miles an hour) to prevent equipment damage.\n",
      "Over the course of a year, modern turbines can generate usable amounts of electricity over 90 percent of the time. For example, if the wind at a turbine reaches the cut-in speed of six to nine mph, the turbine will start generating electricity. As wind speeds increase so does electricity production.\n",
      "Another common measure of wind energy production is called capacity factor. This measures the amount of electricity a wind turbine produces in a given time period (typically a year) relative to its maximum potential.\n",
      "For example, suppose the maximum theoretical output of a two megawatt wind turbine in a year is 17,520 megawatt-hours (two times 8,760 hours, the number of hours in a year). However, the turbine may only produce 7,884 megawatt-hours over the course of the year because the wind wasn’t always blowing hard enough to generate the maximum amount of electricity the turbine was capable of producing. In this case, the turbine has a 45 percent (7,884 divided by 17,520) capacity factor. Remember—this does not mean the turbine only generated electricity 45 percent of the time. Modern wind farms often have capacity factors greater than 40 percent, which is close to some types of coal or natural gas power plants.\n",
      "Windmills vs. Wind Turbines\n",
      "Sometimes people use the terms “windmill” and “wind turbine” interchangeably, but there are important differences. People have been using windmills for centuries to grind grain, pump water, and do other work. Windmills generate mechanical energy, but they do not generate electricity. In contrast, modern wind turbines are highly evolved machines with more than 8,000 parts that harness wind's kinetic energy and convert it into electricity.\n",
      "What is a wind farm?\n",
      "Oftentimes a large number of wind turbines are built close together, which is referred to as a wind project or wind farm. A wind farm functions as a single power plant and sends electricity to the grid.\n",
      "How wind energy gets to you\n",
      "The turbines in a wind farm are connected so the electricity they generate can travel from the wind farm to the power grid. Once wind energy is on the main power grid, electric utilities or power operators will send the electricity to where people need it.\n",
      "Smaller transmission lines, called distribution lines, collect electricity generated at the wind project and transport it to larger \"network\" transmission lines, where the electricity can travel across long distances to the locations where it is needed. Finally, smaller distribution lines deliver electricity directly to your town, home or business. You can learn more about transmission(Opens in a new window) here.\n",

      "U.S. wind power drives unmatched economic development(Opens in a new window) into rural America. Because of extra income(Opens in a new window) from wind projects, family farmers and ranchers have a new source of stable income, small-town schools districts can offer their students(Opens in a new window) top-notch educations and local taxes stay low(Opens in a new window).\n",
      "“Wind energy, the fastest-growing source of electricity in the U.S., is transforming low-income rural areas in ways not seen since the federal government gave land to homesteaders 150 years ago,” Nebraska’s Omaha World-Herald reported(Opens in a new window).\n",
      "Every year, farmers and ranchers who host wind turbines are paid over a quarter of a billion dollars in lease payments. That income can make the difference between continuing a multi-generation tradition and having to sell off the family farm. This steady revenue helps them when commodity prices fluctuate or bad weather hurts the harvest. It’s a new drought-proof cash crop.\n",
      "Local schools often reap some of the largest wind farm benefits. Wind projects substantially expand local tax bases, helping schools offer new services and improve facilities. For example, researchers from Oklahoma State University found wind farms in the Sooner State will pay schools over $1 billion during their lifetimes(Opens in a new window). That means educators can buy new computers, build athletic fields and offer college-level courses in places where they previously didn’t have the resources to offer these opportunities.\n",
      "Over 99 percent of operating wind energy capacity is in rural areas. As wind farms expand the tax base in these areas, it creates new revenue to fix roads, fund law enforcement and keep taxes low. For example, Sheldon, NY fully eliminated local taxes for eight years because wind income covered its entire budgetary needs.\n",

      "The report is organized around activities in the hydraulic fracturing water cycle and their potential to impact drinking water resources.  The stages include: (1) acquiring water to be used for hydraulic fracturing (Water Acquisition), (2) mixing the water with chemical additives to prepare hydraulic fracturing fluids (Chemical Mixing), (3) injecting the hydraulic fracturing fluids into the production well to create fractures in the targeted production zone (Well Injection), (4) collecting the wastewater that returns through the well after injection (Produced Water Handling), and (5) managing the wastewater via disposal or reuse methods (Wastewater Disposal and Reuse).\n",
      "EPA found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. The report identifies certain conditions under which impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities can be more frequent or severe: \n",
      "    • Water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, particularly in areas with limited or declining groundwater resources; \n",
      "    • Spills during the handling of hydraulic fracturing fluids and chemicals or produced water that result in large volumes or high concentrations of chemicals reaching groundwater resources; \n",
      "    • Injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, allowing gases or liquids to move to groundwater resources;\n",
      "    • Injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; \n",
      "    • Discharge of inadequately treated hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface water; and\n",
      "    • Disposal or storage of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in unlined pits resulting in contamination of groundwater resources.\n",
      "Data gaps and uncertainties limited EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts on drinking water resources locally and nationally. Because of these data gaps and uncertainties, it was not possible to fully characterize the severity of impacts, nor was it possible to calculate or estimate the national frequency of impacts on drinking water resources from activities in the hydraulic fracturing water cycle. \n",
      "EPA’s report advances the scientific understanding of hydraulic fracturing’s impact on drinking water resources, and can inform decisions by federal, state, tribal, and local officials; industry; and communities to protect drinking water resources now and in the future.\n",

      "﻿Offshore wind energy\n",
      "\n",
      "Development of the offshore wind resource is at an early stage along California’s Pacific Coast. Offshore wind turbines that are fixed to the ocean floor have been deployed in shallow waters on the East Coast and in Europe. Because the Pacific Coast waters are much deeper, turbines must be mounted on floating platforms that are tethered to the ocean floor. The technologies required to access powerful Pacific winds have recently become available, and project developers are interested to start planning the first offshore wind farms on the West Coast.\n",
      "Offshore wind development offers enormous potential to help meet California’s 100% clean electricity target by 2045. California’s offshore wind resource has the technical potential to produce 392 TWh per year, about 150% of California’s annual electricity load. The offshore wind resource near Humboldt Bay is among the best in the nation, with wind speeds often exceeding 10 meters per second at 90 meters above the ocean’s surface — and even faster at heights around 120 meters, where the turbines are likely to be centered. Furthermore, offshore wind speeds have a consistent profile between different seasons and throughout the day (with a peak in the early evening), offering the ability to provide stable power throughout the year and help balance the grid as solar power goes offline at dusk.\n",
      "Alongside the potential for renewable electricity generation comes a suite of auxiliary benefits and challenges. Development of offshore wind energy in California, and in particular on the north coast, requires special attention to the following areas:\n",
      "    • Transmission and interconnection — Development of large scale wind generation in Humboldt County will quickly exceed the capacity of the regional electrical grid. Delivering clean power from Humboldt County to larger load centers throughout California will require significant upgrades to the transmission infrastructure, which can improve the reliability of the regional electricity grid.\n",
      "    • Port infrastructure — As the northernmost deepwater port in California, the Port of Humboldt Bay may be well situated to become a hub for installation, service, and manufacturing of offshore wind energy components. Cataloging the current condition of port infrastructure and understanding the required improvements can help local and state agencies and private sector companies plan for future port developments.\n",
      "    • Environmental review — Offshore wind development will require a comprehensive environmental review to understand impacts to mammals, fish, birds, plant life, and other organisms in offshore and onshore locations. Studying how ecosystems react to offshore wind farms can help us determine which methods minimize impacts to species and habitats, and whether offshore wind is compatible with this marine environment.\n",
      "    • Stakeholders — Development of offshore wind energy will create benefits (such as jobs) and concerns (such as impacts to other ocean resource uses) for different stakeholder groups. Conducting outreach with stakeholders can help inform strategies to manage potential conflicts and create overlapping benefits for different groups.\n",

      "Nanomaterials are increasingly influencing the food sector. Research and development is taking place to investigate the potential benefits and risks of using nanomaterials to change the properties of food, for example, its taste or texture. With the increased use of nanomaterials in the food and feed chain, it is important to know the properties and characteristics of nanomaterials and determine whether they raise any potential health or environmental concerns.\n",
      "In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is responsible for the risk assessment of the use of nanomaterials in food and feed, as well as in food contact materials. This is to establish if there are any risks to take into account before the use is authorised. The assessment is done by EFSA’s scientific panels, which comprise independent experts from all over Europe. Subsequent authorisation, decided by the Member States and the European Commission, sets out the conditions of use and any labelling requirements for the nanomaterials.\n",
      "Several regulations already exist in the EU that specifically cover the use of nanomaterials in the food sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Novel food\n",
      "\n",
      "European Food Safety Authority - What is novel food?\n",
      "Under EU law, a novel food is a food that was not consumed significantly in the EU before 15 May 1997, when the first regulation on novel food came into force. Novel food can be newly developed, innovative food, food produced using new technologies and production processes, and food which is or has been traditionally consumed outside the EU. Food consisting of, or containing, engineered nanomaterials is also considered as novel food. The regulation on novel food has its own definition of ‘engineered nanomaterial’, which is also used in the regulation on food information to consumers.\n",
      "The Novel Foods Regulation sets out obligations that apply to engineered nanomaterials – nanomaterials that have been deliberately engineered to have specific properties – including requirements for placing a novel food on the EU market, such as prior authorisation of the material by the European Commission. A novel food will only be approved for use in the EU if they do not present a risk to public health, are not nutritionally disadvantageous when replacing a similar food, and are not misleading to the consumer.\n",
      " \n",
      "Nanomaterials as food additives\n",
      "The Food Additives Regulation lays down a list of approved food additives, enzymes and flavourings. If there are changes in the production process or in the starting materials of an already approved food additive, it will be considered a different additive and will need to be re-evaluated. A significant difference in the starting materials is, for example, a change in particle size, including through the use of nanotechnology.\n",
      "Labelling of food containing engineered nanomaterials\n",
      "The Food Information to Consumers (FIC) Regulation sets the rules for the labelling of food ingredients, with requirements that apply to engineered nanomaterials in food products. Under the regulation, all ingredients that are engineered nanomaterials need to be clearly indicated in the list of ingredients. The names of such ingredients must be followed by the word ‘nano’ in brackets.\n",
      "Nanomaterials in plastic food contact materials\n",
      "\n",
      "European Food Safety Authority - What do we mean by food contact materials?\n",
      "Food contact materials are extensively used in the food supply chain to transport and protect food – for instance, we can find them around the sandwiches that we eat and the milk that we buy. There are several regulations that aim to make sure that harmful chemicals are not released into the food, such as the general food contact materials legislation, as well as the Plastic Food Contact Materials Regulation.\n",
      "The Plastic Food Contact Materials Regulation focusses partly on the potential for release of chemicals from food contact materials, as well as on avoiding the use of harmful chemicals in such materials. It sets out rules on the composition of plastic food contact materials and establishes a Union list of substances that are permitted for use in the manufacture of plastic food contact materials. The regulation also specifies restrictions on the use of these substances and sets out rules to determine the compliance of plastic materials and articles.\n",
      "For multi-layer materials or articles, even the plastic layer which is not in direct contact with the food and is separated from the food by a functional barrier may contain substances in nanoform only if the nanoform is explicitly authorised.\n",
      "Nanomaterials in active and intelligent food contact materials\n",
      "Active and intelligent food contact materials extend shelf-life by maintaining or improving the condition of packaged food by releasing or absorbing substances into or from the food or the environment surrounding it. Some examples are food packaging materials, cutlery, dishes and cutting boards.\n",
      "The EU regulation on active and intelligent materials and articles foresees the establishment of a Union list of substances permitted for the manufacture of active and intelligent materials.\n",

      "The website provides the general public with the opportunity to register as stakeholders; conveys the latest information and outputs of the assessment process for review and comments; and describes the opportunities for how stakeholders can engage further in the assessment over the 24 month SEA process. The website will also serve as a ‘knowledge portal’ for authors and experts comprising the assessment team, by providing them with a virtual library of all relevant journal papers, reports and spatial data which will be used during SEA process.\n",
      "The Need for an SEA\n",
      "The potential future economic and energy security benefits of a large resource of natural gas in South Africa could be substantial; as are both the positive and negative social and environmental issues of establishing a domestic gas industry in the Karoo region.\n",
      "South African government, through Cabinet and various other decision-making institutions, has made high-level public commitments to shale gas exploration. If the exploration phase occurs and yields successful hydrocarbon deposits and gas-flow regimes, it is a reasonable assumption that Government would consider development of those resources at a significant scale. DEA, along with other relevant authorities, need to be in a position to make decisions relevant to that choice in a timely and responsible fashion.\n",
      "Although a substantial amount is already known about shale gas development and its consequences based on experience from around the world, very little is known about the industry in the South African context, which makes information very hard for decision-makers and stakeholders to evaluate. In order to make well-informed decisions and have some hope that decisions will be broadly accepted by stakeholders as credible and legitimate, a structured and transparent process of information sharing and scientific assessment needs to take place.\n",

It is undertaken by the Project Team (CSIR, SANBI and CGS) in close consultation with the various affected Departments. It commences with initial drafts after the delivery of the first draft of the Assessment report, and with final drafts after the delivery of the final Assessment report. The separation of the teams between phase 2 and 3 is to honour the assessment ‘mantra’ of being ‘policy relevant, but not policy prescriptive’. The experts in Phase 2 are not being asked to make decisions about the development of shale gas. They are being asked to give an informed opinion on the consequences of different options. The decisions must be made by mandated authorities (i.e. government), who have contracted the science councils to help them in formulating the framework and content of such decisions\n",

      "﻿Leader in wind turbine management and maintenance \n",
      "15 years ago, ECN part of TNO was one of the first to think about innovation in management and maintenance. While others still focused mainly on the construction of wind turbines, ECN part of TNO investigated how the offshore wind turbines could remain in operation as efficiently as possible. The models that have been developed are among the most advanced in the world. \n",
      "The result of these efforts is that wind turbines produce as much energy as possible and as cheaply as possible at the lowest possible cost throughout their service life - from day one to their disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing and maintaining offshore wind turbines is a major challenge, especially in large wind farms. ECN part of TNO has developed software tools that enable owners to calculate the extent of the damage if, for example, a cable connecting the park to the mainland breaks down or a lightning strike occurs, and how all conceivable defects can be remedied as efficiently as possible. In large wind farms with 100 or more turbines, maintenance without processing power is now impossible.\n",
      "Maintenance-friendly\n",
      "Taiwan, where ECN part of TNO is also active, is known for its typhoons. Five to six months of the year, these severe storms hit the island. During these periods, maintenance at sea is virtually impossible. These exceptional circumstances also had an impact on the design of the wind turbines. \n",
      "\n",
      "New turbine models can now cope with a lot of turbulent weather conditions. The somewhat older models - some 10-15 per cent in total - sometimes suffer damage during heavy weather, despite all the precautions taken. In most cases, repair is still possible: the blades or the head are replaced, and then immediately by more advanced and better quality parts. Nowadays, wind turbines are built for 25 to 30 years.\n",
      "Extended service life\n",
      "ECN part of TNO has also designed tools to calculate how much maintenance a turbine needs on the basis of a few measured wind turbines, and how this will work out for the rest of the wind turbines in the park. Calculations are made of the load capacity. This varies according to the wind force on the blades. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is useful knowledge. Some turbines at specific locations in the parks will be subjected to lighter loads and may therefore require less maintenance. Most turbines run 80 percent of their time at 80 percent power: in the event of a major storm, the blades now turn first partly out of the wind to continue generating energy in a lower position for as long as possible, until they switch off for only a very short time at peak to avoid causing a massive power dip in the energy system.\n",

      "Statement by the Ministers of DEA, Ms Edna Molewa, Science and Technology, Naledi Pandor, Deputy Minister of Mineral Resources, Godfrey Oliphant, at the launch of the Strategic Environmental Assessment of shale gas development with the Ministries of Water Affairs & Sanitation, and Energy \n",
      " \n",
      "12 May 2015\n",
      " \n",
      "We are gathered at this briefing today as a Ministerial Task Team and our Technical Team consisting of Departments of Minerals Resources, Environmental Affairs, Science and Technology, Water and Sanitation and Energy. Our objective today is to inform South Africans and the media of one of our initiatives as a country, to investigate possible impacts and potential mitigation opportunities of shale gas, if found.\n",
      "Thank you for being here with us at this very important occasion. Today we take the crucial first step towards the further development of South Africa’s energy landscape; namely the commissioning of the Strategic Environmental Assessment of Shale Gas Development.\n",
      "If indeed viable deposits are found in South Africa, shale gas, as a relatively lower carbon energy source presents significant transformative potential for the South African economy.\n",
      "Today’s launch takes place at a time when the global energy landscape is undergoing dramatic change; as unconventional oil and gas resources fuel an energy boom with profound impacts.\n",
      "South Africa, like most countries around the globe, is mindful of the need to seek alternative energy sources like shale gas, which though a ‘fossil fuel, is relatively not like coal’, with a lesser environmental impact.\n",
      "South Africa’s National Development Plan (NDP) outlines the vision for our country’s transition to an environmentally sustainable, climate-change resilient, low-carbon inclusive economy.\n",
      "As clearly articulated in our National Integrated Resource Plan (NIRP), shale gas together with other energy sources, form an integral part of this vision: with its ultimate aim being to support our societal transformation and economic growth.\n",
      "Ladies and Gentlemen, at a time of energy scarcity for our country this launch is both timely and critical.\n",
      "Not only could the exploitation of deposits of lower carbon shale gas – if found, result in the provision of affordable and safe energy: it is also a potential source of job creation, foreign exchange and investment – and overall contribute towards South Africa’s energy security. We do however recognise we are not at a stage where we can say with certainty that there are significant deposits.\n",
      "We are here today specifically to launch the commissioning of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for shale gas development.\n",
      "Before elaborating on the process and project approach of the Assessment, we would like to provide some background on the steps that led to this project announcement.\n",
      "Cabinet established an Interdepartmental Task Team to investigate the possibility of addressing any anticipated challenge that we may face in our endeavour to develop shale gas in our country. The concerns we have been tasked to consider are as follows:\n",
      "    • Environmental impact on ecosystems, waste management etc.\n",
      "    • Challenges of impact on water, given that South Africa is a water-scarce country, and\n",
      "    • Possible impact on the already progressing Square Kilometre Array program.\n",
      "    • Establishment of a regulatory regime that would guide all processes.\n",
      "Square Kilometre Array (SKA)\n",
      " \n",
      "Having considered the vital importance of the SKA for our country and the world, the Interdepartmental Task Team has made a decision to ensure that the shale gas initiative must never impact negatively on the SKA. The SEA must therefore take this decision into cognisance in the extensive investigation that we are embarking upon.\n",
      "Steps Preceding the Strategic Environmental Assessment of Shale Gas Development\n",
      " \n",
      "In July 2012, we began implementing a planned, step-wise approach towards our investigation where progress in respect to each step informs decisions in respect of the next step.\n",
      "The Interdepartmental task team report on the investigation of hydraulic fracturing revealed that there is a lack of information locally to enable robust decision-making on the matter. \n",
      "We made two commitments to address the current lack of information and knowledge, namely, the development of a ‘first pass’ Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to identify sensitive areas for shale gas development and secondly, the production of research around the actual greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas extraction, transport and use, if shale gas is found.\n",
      "Considering this dearth of information locally on shale gas exploitation, extraction and development, and in line with our core Departmental mandates, the Departments of Environmental Affairs (DEA), Water and Sanitation (DWS), Science and Technology and Mineral Resources commissioned this SEA for Shale Gas Development.\n",
      "Our Team will be supported by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) and the Council for Geosciences (CGS).\n",
      "Sustainable Development\n",
      " \n",
      "We would like to reiterate commitment to our constitutional mandate as well as our government policy on “Sustainable Development”, which is to secure an environment that is not harmful to the health and well-being of our people, while also ensuring that our South African socio-economic growth is not hampered.\n",
      "Ours is to ensure a balance in the three pillars of sustainable development, namely socio-economic growth, consideration of impacts on people and protecting and conserving the environment for future generations.\n",
      "The Strategic Environmental Assessment for shale gas development will thus be conducted as a science-based assessment to improve our understanding of the risks and opportunities of shale gas development. We believe that this will assist government to create a framework and guiding principles to inform responsible decision-making.\n",
      "The Strategic Environmental Assessment will consider both exploration and production related activities and impacts of shale gas development, including the process of hydraulic fracturing, and will include an assessment of all material social, economic and biophysical risks and opportunities presented.\n",
      "The study area will include regions of the Karoo Basin which currently have exploration rights applications pending in the Northern, Eastern and Western Cape Provinces.  This Strategic Environmental Assessment for shale gas development was will run over 24 months duration.\n",
      "Guiding regulations\n",
      " \n",
      "The process of exploration will however not stop. This is due to another milestone we have already registered regarding the successful conclusion of the necessary regulations by Department of Mineral Resources which will be published soon.These regulations will be used to guide the exploration process which is highly imperative in determining the possible existence and magnitude of shale gas, if found.\n",
      "Our Approach\n",
      " \n",
      "We have since appointed a project team comprising of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) and the Council for Geosciences (CGS) to undertake the Strategic Environmental Assessment. \n",
      "The project team will be led by our world-renowned academic, Systems Ecologist, Professor Bob Scholes of the University of Witwatersrand, who is also a research associate of the CSIR. \n",
      "The significance of this project is that its governance structure and approach will ensure three key principles, namely, that:\n",
      "    • The SEA must be ‘salient’ and cover all the important issues and concerns around shale gas.\n",
      "    • Secondly, the SEA must include groups of leading experts to ensure ‘credibility’, and\n",
      "    • Thirdly, the SEA must be grounded in transparent and participatory processes to ensure ‘legitimacy’.\n",
      "An extensive governance approach has been adopted and includes extensive stakeholder participation from the industry, private sector, NGO sector, CBO and community sector, as well as all three spheres of government.\n",
      "The three affected provinces, namely the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape Provinces are part of the national Project Executive Committee.  The governance structure also includes a process custodian group comprising of 15 representatives from government, research institutions, industry experts, and NGOs.  The custodian group will oversee the SEA process, ensuring that all the relevant sectors and parties are included and that the SEA follows the correct process.\n",

      "For High Barrier Applications \n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "Pioneered by InMat Inc., Nanolok coatings start as aqueous suspensions of nanodispersed silicates in a polymer matrix. They are environmentally friendly, and can be applied via gravure coating processes to polyester film (or other substrates using appropriate adhesives). Nanolok technology provides the highest gas barrier of any polymeric coating available on the market today. \n",
      "What are the benefits?\n",
      "    • Reduced material/structure costs \n",
      "    • Same level of barrier achieved with coatings on different substrates (OPP same as PET) \n",
      "    • Cost effective vs. EVOH, PVDC \n",
      "    • High transparency (see-through clarity) \n",
      "    • Can be gravure applied \n",
      "    • Thin coating maintains physical properties of the substrate \n",
      "    • Recyclability \n",
      "    • Environmentally friendly \n",
      "How does it work?\n",
      "The Nanolok aqueous suspension is applied via roll (or dip, or spray) coating process onto a polyester film or other substrate. Once dry, a very thin coating (0.25-2 microns or 0.01-0.08mils) of Nanolok forms on the substrate. \n",
      "This coating contains hundreds of nanodispersed platelets per micron of coating thickness. These platelets form a tortuous path for molecules such as oxygen and aromatics, dramatically increasing the barrier properties of the substrate. Nanolok coatings form an extremely efficient barrier which can be 100s of times less permeable than the uncoated substrate. In addition, these coatings are transparent, thus useful for see-through packaging applications. Thin coatings are applied, making these coatings highly cost-effective: approximately 1-2 microns (0.04-0.08 mil) of Nanolok coating, for example can replace 12 microns (0.5 mil) of EVOH to achieve the same level of oxygen barrier.\n",

      "﻿Fracking - An Overview\n",
      "Catskill Mountainkeeper was one of the first environmental groups to challenge fracking in New York, and our team played a central role in the uphill coalition fight that won the historic 2015 state-wide ban on high-volume hydraulic fracturing in low permeable shale—the first such ban by a state with large, potentially profitable, natural gas reserves.\n",
      "Mountainkeeper’s unique blend of expert advocacy and political savvy—fueled by the power of our grassroots activist supporters and our staff's fierce determination to win against all odds—were key to the coalition’s success in galvanizing the massive public outcry that finally convinced Governor Cuomo to protect the health of New Yorkers, and the integrity of our environment, from fracking.\n",
      "Mountainkeeper’s contributions to this fight included shining a light on the fracking’s health impacts and calling for a comprehensive Health Impact Assessment of the practice; pressuring state officials to re-open New York’s drilling regulations; supporting towns in passing their own local fracking bans; and building and uniting a diverse anti-fracking movement including local front-line groups and national organizations.\n",
      "New York State’s ban is a important victory for the health and safety of our communities and the environment, but the fight is not yet over, both in New York and in other parts of the country.  Mountainkeeper is protecting our success by blocking efforts to undermine or overturn the New York state ban, and by lending our expertise to support the work of allies in other fracking battlefields, like California, Maryland, and Ohio. The fracking victory in New York also continues to provide important momentum for the broader effort to fight projects that perpetuate our nation’s dependence on dirty fossil fuels, and to promote clean, green, and sustainable smart energy policies built around renewables and energy efficiency. \n",
      "Background \n",
      "\n",
      "Why Mountainkeeper Fought Fracking in New York State\n",
      "The Catskills is a prime drilling location for natural gas because it sits on top of the Marcellus Shale field, the Utica Shale field and three other target formations.  \n",
      "These are enormous, subterranean layers of shale rock between 6000 – 8000 feet below the surface that run east from the Catskills, south from the Mohawk Valley to West Virginia and west through Pennsylvania and Ohio. The pores and fractures of the shale contain natural gas. Geologists have known about the gas here for years but with new technologies of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, recovering the gas has become cost effective.\n",
      "Process for getting gas out of the ground\n",
      "The process for getting the gas out of the shale is highly industrial and includes numerous truckloads of equipment, toxic chemicals, sand and water along with generators, pumps, drilling rigs and hoists. In addition to the drill, the site contains a large holding pond for the contaminated waste products from the process. The wells run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and produce exhaust, fumes and noise.  The sound of a drill is comparable to the sound of a jet engine. When gas is found there can be a release of the various gases in the formation.\n",
      "What is fracking?\n",
      "Fracking is a technique used to create fractures in the shale to allow gas to travel more easily from the rock pores where the gas is trapped, to the production well. In order to create fractures a mixture of water, sand and toxic chemicals is pumped into the rock under high pressure. When the fluid can no longer be absorbed the pressure causes the formation to crack or fracture and allows the gas to flow through the fractures to the well. Some of the fracturing fluids are pumped out of the well and into surface holding pits or tanks but studies have shown that anywhere between 20-40% of fracking fluids may remain underground.\n",
      "The process of fracking requires millions of gallons of water, which are drawn from area lakes and rivers and transported in large 18 wheeler trucks over local roads. Each million gallons of water in fracking fluid includes 40,000 lbs. of chemicals. Therefore, conservatively, if each individual fracking uses 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 gallons of water there will be anywhere from 120,000 lbs. up to 240,000 lbs. of chemicals. There are reports of some fracking operations taking up to 8,000,000 gallons – that’s 320,000 lbs. of chemicals that will be shipped over our local roads to be mixed onsite with the 800 tractor trailer loads of water. If 70% is recovered from the well that is 5,600,000 gallons of contaminated water to be shipped to a wastewater facility in 560 tractor trailers. This is one well, one fracking operation. There are multiple frackings done at one well and New York State is planning tens of thousands of wells across the state.    (This is based on a tractor trailer load carrying 10,000 gallons a load.)\n",
      "What is wrong with fracking?\n",
      "Based on what has happened in other communities, including in neighboring Pennsylvania, we now know the dire environmental and health consequences of gas drilling, which is why Catskill Mountainkeeper fought so hard for fracking to be banned in New York State. \n",
      "Risks to human health\n",
      "There are risks to human health present at every step of the hydraulic fracturing gas extraction process, from the contamination of drinking water sources, noise emissions, compressor stations to the intense truck traffic required over a well’s life–cycle. The detrimental health impacts of fracking have been linked to asthma, infertility, ADHD, autism, diabetes, thyroid disorders, brain disorders, many types of cancer and more.\n",
      "Water contamination \n",
      "Fracking has the potential to cause irreparable and widespread contamination of our water supply. These irreversible impacts include contamination of groundwater from the toxic chemicals used in fracking, depletion of aquifers to support the fracking process, and contamination from the production of billions of gallons of hazardous wastewater byproducts produced by this process.\n",
      "Air pollution\n",
      "Air pollution is released at all stages of gas drilling operations, however, the volume of emissions from an individual well site generally do not meet the threshold that is required to have air permits, so the type and amount of air pollutants from tens of thousands of well sites that are projected for our state will not be tracked. The typical contaminants that come from fracking operations include:  volatile organic compounds, such as benzene, which combines with nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere to form ground level ozone; methane which is a powerful green house gas; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) which cause cancer; sulfur dioxide (SO2) which creates small particles that get lodged in the lungs and can lead to many health problems and acid rain.  Typical health problems include asthma, cancer, neurological damage, pulmonary reduction, coronary problems, endocrine disruption and headaches.  In The Tupper Green River Basin in Wyoming’s gas land, ozone levels are above those in Los Angeles on its worst days.\n",
      "Danger to our food supply\n",
      "Fracking presents a huge danger to our food supply.  Much of the land that is sitting on top of the giant underground shale field is active farmland. Fracking this land has the potential to disrupt farming productivity, endanger livestock health and affect produce and livestock quality.\n",
      "The threat of earthquakes\n",
      "There are a rising number of earthquakes in areas where there is hydraulic fracturing and growing scientific information shows that forcing fluids under high pressure deep underground can increase regional seismic activity.\n",
      "Flooding could be catastrophic\n",
      "The cycle of global climate change, which has caused unprecedented flooding in the Catskills over the last 5 years is expected to continue.  This could lead to disastrous repercussions if flooding overwhelmed drilling sites and swept toxic chemicals and radioactivity from fracking materials into our general water supply.\n",
      "Danger to the economic viability of our communities and their social fabric\n",
      "Far from being the economic panacea that is promised by the gas companies, the socioeconomic impacts of fracking could have onerous effects on individuals and communities.  It would increase the burden on local infrastructure to maintain the roads and bridges that would be damaged by heavy truck traffic; increase costs to fund emergency personnel for emergency services to deal with industrial accidents; increase the cost for law enforcement to deal with increased crime that traditionally follows the influx of out-of-state workers. Rents would spike in communities and locals would be priced out of the market.  Property values would fall as the land was industrialized which would in turn lower tax assessments and decrease the income to municipalities. If you or your neighbor has a gas well, chances are you would not be able to sell your property, as most banks would not lend on properties that have industrial activity, and you could lose your title insurance for the same reason.  Existing local industries such as tourism, outdoor recreation and agriculture, would all be negatively affected, and the boom and bust nature of gas drilling would likely leave your communities in much worse shape after the drilling rigs leave.\n",
      "Despite these known hazards, the oil and gas industry is exempt from important provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other federal environmental laws. The absence of federal regulatory oversight has left it up to individual states to regulate this industry and adequately enforce regulations.\n",

      "1 June 2015 • 1 min reading time \n",
      "On 1 June 2015, within the framework of the Horizon 2020 research programme, the European Commission has sanctioned the start of one of the first major European studies into the effects of shale gas production on people and the environment. TNO is coordinating the work of a consortium of eighteen research institutes from ten European countries in the project M4ShaleGas (‘Measuring, monitoring, mitigating, managing the environmental impact of shale gas’).\n",
      "The research questions include:\n",
      "    • What impact does shale gas extraction have on the subsurface?\n",
      "    • What effects do above-ground activities and installations have on the landscape and groundwater?\n",
      "    • Which consequences do greenhouse gas emissions have on the quality of air?\n",
      "    • How does knowledge on shale gas extraction contribute to the public debate?\n",
      "Research shale gas extraction process\n",
      "All components of the shale gas extraction process are subject to risks analysis and risk reduction. In the M4ShaleGas project all research institutes collaborate, collect the best practices from the United States, and run experiments to detect the behaviour of the European shale sedimentary rocks. In addition, models are developed to predict the impact of fracking methods and measurements are designed to reduce the risk of environmental damage.\n",
      "Consortium partners\n",
      "The consortium partners are independent research institutes that provide the necessary scientific knowledge which will help the European Commission in drawing up policy on shale gas production in Europe. For data of existing shale gas activities abroad input is requested from current operators. An industry panel ensures that experiences of companies are shared with the consortium. The consortium does not interfere in the political and social discussion on utility and necessity of shale gas extraction, but can provide factual information.\n",
      "Best practices from the Netherlands are also collected in the project and experiments conducted to find out the behaviour of European shale sedimentary rock.\n",

      "﻿Accurately mixing oil and water.\n",
      "Mayonnaise, milk, hair conditioner and medicinal ointment: all examples in which oil and water are mixed. But oil and water do not mix well. At Wageningen University, a chip has been developed that can create this type of emulsions very accurately. ‘The chip can be used to mix any substance that we add to it.’\n",
      "The EDGE (Edge-based Droplet GEneration) chip created by professor Karin Schroën and PhD student Sami Sahin is technically a thick sieve, they explain. ‘The chip is made up of several layers of microchannels. For a modest production volume, we can produce twenty cubic metres of product per hour for oil percentages of up to thirty percent,’ says the PhD student. ‘And we have demonstrated that it is possible to make oil droplets that are all exactly ten micrometres in size.’ With the EDGE chip, you can even calibrate the size of the droplets.\n",
      "The size of the oil droplets determines how creamy a food product tastes. By using this chip, the same creamy taste can be achieved with less fat.\n",
      "Creamy taste with less fat.\n",
      "The dimensions of the oil droplets are important for a wide range of applications. For example, the size of the oil droplets determines how creamy a food product tastes. As with the current mixing methods the oil droplets produced are not only the large, creamy tasting droplets, but also less desirable small droplets, manufacturers often add slightly more oil than necessary to ensure the desired taste. Using the chip from Wageningen University, all oil droplets are exactly the same size. This way, the same creamy taste can be achieved with less fat.\n",
      "No overdosing in the case of medicines.\n",
      "The chip can also yield advantages for the production of medicines. For example, you can selectively reach certain organs in the body by using emulsions of oil droplets with specific dimensions. In addition, droplets with the same dimensions always contain exactly the same quantity of active substance. This means you can use the chip to prevent overdosing.\n",
      "From sixty football fields to office size.\n",
      "‘When Sami Sahin started his PhD research, we had a chip that did the same but would have required a surface area of sixty football fields to produce sufficient amounts. Thanks to Sami’s smart new design, we have reduced that to ten square metres. And because you the chips can be stacked, the complete production facility can now easily fit inside my office,’ says professor Schroën.\n",
      "Identical droplets.\n",
      "The chip is made of glass in which microchannels have been etched, explain the researchers. ‘We allow a layer of oil to run over a plateau. As there is a pressure difference before and after the plateau, the oil spontaneously forms droplets. The surface forces, viscosity and friction with the walls ensure that these droplets are always exactly the same size.’ By adjusting the shape of the channels and the pressure difference, you can calibrate the droplet size.\n",
      "Fabrication.\n",
      "Fabricating Sahin’s design was far from easy, says Schroën. ‘Eventually, we found Cytocentrics, a development company that designs and produces microsystems, willing to seek the boundaries of its technology for us.’ ‘Realising Sami’s design was a fantastic challenge,’ says Cytocentrics product engineer Arne Heessels. ‘To ensure that all of the oil droplets are exactly the same size, the channels may not differ from each other in the slightest. We therefore had to etch the holes with exceptional accuracy. We eventually decided to treat the top and bottom of the chip separately. But we had to ensure that the holes in the bottom plate would line up exactly with those in the top plate. That was an exceptionally tough technical challenge. We were therefore extremely pleased when a video showed that the chips made the exact droplets and mixtures that Sami and Karin had intended.’\n",
      "Fig. left: Schematic 3D representation of multi-EDGE device. Oil is pushed from the bottom side and the droplets emerge at the top side. Fig. right: schematic section view.\n",
      "Schematic top view (fig. left) and schematic bottom view (fig. right).\n",
      "Optical micrographs of the top side, before and during emulsification. Droplets are carried away from left to right by the cross flowing continuous phase; please note that the cross-flow is not needed for droplet formation.\n",
      "Developing and producing a prototype.\n",
      "Sahin received his doctorate at the end of May 2016. Now he wants to develop a prototype with the help of an STW Demonstrator Grant so that the possibilities of the chip can be demonstrated to industry, tells Schroën. ‘We want to increase the yield by a factor of ten and gain an even better understanding of the process.’ ‘In addition, we need to demonstrate that the chip can run 24/7,’ says Sahin. ‘We have a lot of knowledge about the settings you can tweak to create various sizes and quantities of oil droplets, and now we want to share this knowledge with interested manufacturers. This way, we can advise them about the formulas that they must use to realise a final product with the desired properties. This could be the texture of a cream, the final taste experience of a dressing, or the concentrations of active substances in a medicine,’ he says.\n",
      "Cytocentrics can produce this first prototype and possibly make a small run of these as well. ‘However, once the switch is made to larger volumes, we would like to transfer the technology to a party that can handle bulk production,’ says Heessels.\n",
      "Demonstrating the advantages.\n",
      "‘The profit margins in the food industry are very small. We must therefore offer a big advantage compared to the current methods. For example, our mixing method uses 90% less energy than the current standard equipment used to produce emulsions (homogenisers), and with our chip we can even improve the properties of the product. By demonstrating how our chip works, we hope that a company will take over its further development, so that the chip will actually be used within the food industry,’ concludes Schroën.\n",

      "﻿Pros and Cons of Geothermal Energy \n",
      "The temperature at earth’s core exists at roughly 7200 degrees Fahrenheit. This is due to the decay of radioactive materials millions of years ago. The high temperature beneath the earth’s surface can produce enormous amount of energy that could produce several gigawatts of electricity. Technically speaking, geothermal energy is a renewable source of energy that can produce energy as long as the Earth exists.\n",
      "Geothermal energy is clean, sustainable, environment friendly, cost-effective and reliable. Geothermal energy resources range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles beneath the Earth’s surface. It can also be found deeper into the Earth’s interior due to the extremely high temperatures and pressures of molten rock called magma. In the United States, most geothermal reservoirs of hot water are located in the western states, Alaska, and Hawaii.\n",
      "Geothermal energy is a type of energy that can really make it easy for companies to get what they need without using a lot of fossil fuels in the process. In this article, we’re going to take a closer look at some of the most important pros and cons that are related to using geothermal energy for your home or for your business when it comes to energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sooner we get started with alternative energy sources and recognize that fossil fuels makes us less secure as a nation, and more dangerous as a planet, the better off we’ll be. ~ ~ Lindsey Graham\n",
      "Pros of Geothermal Energy\n",
      "1. Renewable Source\n",
      "Geothermal energy is extracted from earth’s core and will be available as long as earth exists. It is therefore renewable and can be used for roughly another 4-5 billion years. While fossil fuels have an expiry date, renewable sources like geothermal energy is not going to expire anytime soon.\n",
      "2. Environment Friendly\n",
      "Geothermal energy is green in all aspects of its production and use! It is actually known for having the least impact of any power source. When it comes to the process of developing and making it, geothermal power is practically completely emission free. There is absolutely zero carbon used when it comes to the production of this type of power. Also, the whole procedure can clean out sulfur that may have generally been discharged from other processes.\n",
      "3. No Fuel Needed\n",
      "No fuel is used at all during the production and use of the energy. Why? Because there is absolutely no mining or transportation related to the process, which means that there aren’t trucks emitting fumes and gas, which means that the atmosphere is not being as affected by the process.\n",
      "4. Abundant Supply\n",
      "With geothermal energy, there are no shortages or other sorts of problems that sometimes occur with other types of power. They are not subject to the same issues as solar or wind power, which means that you won’t get a shortage because the weather isn’t cooperating with what you want. There is a practically boundless supply. It is also intrinsically basic and dependable, so you don’t have to worry about it being more of a hassle than it is actually worth.\n",
      "5. Significant Savings for Home Owners\n",
      "There has been a tremendous increase in the number of homeowners who want to utilize geothermal energy for heating and cooling purposes. The result is that less energy is used for heating homes and offices which results in significant savings for home owners. It might prove expensive initially but 30-60% savings on heating and 25-50% savings on cooling can cover that cost within few years. A geothermal heat pump can help you save enough money in energy costs.\n",
      "6. Smallest Land Footprint\n",
      "Geothermal energy extracts heat from hot water, the steam from hot water move the turbines that produce electricity. To extract this energy, substantial amount of piping is required to be laid underground. But, thanks to new innovation in the field of technology, geothermal energy has the smallest land footprint of any major energy source in the world.\n",
      "The costs are very competitive. As of now, geothermal energy is quite cost aggressive in a few areas where it is being produced, so you want to keep an eye on how much it is changing the world of energy in the areas where it is located.\n",
      "7. Innovation in Technology\n",
      "When it comes to green energy, geothermal energy is one of the first types that is being explored. New innovations are coming out for it all of the time, which means that it will likely be easier to deal with some of the difficulties with the technology as time goes on. It can also be manufactured underground. New innovations that are coming out are basically guaranteed to be able to use lower temperatures in future iterations of the technology as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons of Geothermal Energy\n",
      "1. Suitable to Particular Region\n",
      "Everything that deals with geothermal power seems to be really far away from, well, everything that is in and around the area. Prime destinations are exceptionally zone specific, so you can’t really find geothermal power outside of those areas. Also, the prime destinations are frequently a long way from urban areas, which means that they’re virtually useless when it comes to cities and such.\n",
      "2. High Initial Costs\n",
      "For those residential owners who are thinking to use geothermal energy, high upfront costs is something that turns out to be a huge setback to them. For an average sized home, installation of geothermal heat pumps costs between $10,000 – $20,000 that can pay off itself in another 5-10 years down the line through significant cost savings.\n",
      "3. Cost of Powering the Pump\n",
      "Geothermal heat pumps still needs a power source that can run it. The pumps needs electricity to run that can transfer energy from earth’s core to the home. For a homeowner who is planning to go green, can use few solar panels that can power heat pump to draw energy from the earth’s reservoir.\n",
      "4. Surface Instability\n",
      "Geothermal has become infamous for causing earthquakes as setting up of geothermal power plants can alter the land’s structure. A process called hydraulic fracturing is an integral part for building a large scale and efficient geothermal system power plants that can trigger earthquakes.\n",
      "5. Environmental Concerns\n",
      "There are some environmental concerns. Water use is one of the big concerns, because geothermal power uses a lot of water in its processes and such. There are also a number of different compounds that go into the air, water, and ground as a result of the process, including sulfur dioxide and silica discharges, both of which can harm the environment if you aren’t careful about it.\n",
      "Sometimes, you have to deal with some technical difficulties as a result of the way that geothermal power is used. Misfortunes can occur because of how far the power has to travel, and mistakes can occur sometimes that make it difficult for the energy to get to people in an efficient manner.\n",
      "6. High Temperatures Needed\n",
      "The process is not exactly an easy one for you to execute. Boring into warmed rock is extremely troublesome. In order for geothermal processes to begin, you also need the area in question to be at least 350 degrees Fahrenheit, otherwise the processes may not occur as you wish them to.\n",
      "7. May Run Out of Steam\n",
      "You have to be incredibly careful when you are trying to check everything that is related to geothermal energy. Mind must be taken to watch the heat and not to abuse it, because if the heat is not taken care of properly, it can cause a meltdown or other issues where the energy is not properly distributed or used.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hurricane Sandy proved that New York City’s energy system is not up to the challenges of the present day.  And, as we have highlighted before, the city faces some major challenges to reducing dangerous air pollution caused by heavy heating fuels.  One promising solution seeking to significantly reduce NYC’s carbon footprint, improve air quality, and increase grid resiliency during storms is geothermal heat pumps.\n",
      "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called ground source heat pumps the “most energy-efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective space conditioning systems available.”  Geothermal heat pumps or exchangers, also known as geo-exchange, require no fossil-fuel burning on-site, use 70 percent of their energy from Earth’s renewable sources and are, on average, nearly 50 percent more efficient than gas furnaces.\n",
      "Last month, I had the honor of watching NYC Mayor Bloomberg sign a bill tasking the New York City Office of Long-Term Planning & Sustainability to study geothermal energy resources and the feasibility of city-wide adoption of geothermal heating and cooling.  As Mayor Bloomberg’s sustainability leadership – in an official capacity at least – comes to an end, his plans to ensure that the city’s mission to find sustainable, cost-effective solutions to combat air pollution are well underway.  Though the geothermal heating and cooling bill is very important, it is only one aspect of the Mayor’s larger PlaNYC effort.\n",
      "During his speech, Mayor Bloomberg remarked, “So what is geothermal anyway? I am having it installed in the new place I just bought and I know it works and how much it costs but nothing else.”  His words sum up the greatest challenge for geo-exchange yet – lack of awareness.  Geo-exchange technology needs our help to move it out of its prolonged infancy and into the mainstream.\n",
      "The most common misconception holding it back is that geothermal energy will generate electricity, which is only true if you live atop a volcano. Here, in New York, Earth’s sub-surface temperature isn’t quite hot enough to produce electricity. What it does allow for, though, is a cleaner, resilient, and largely cheaper heating and cooling option for thousands of homes and offices – as the tapped heat not only provides heating in the winter, but also air conditioning in the summer.\n",
      "Under the guidance of Mayor Bloomberg’s PlaNYC, New York City will set the pace for the rest of the country to make way for efficient, non-fossil fuel burning geothermal.  There are already a few projects underway in hospitals, museums, schools, and the highly anticipated Cornell Tech Campus on Roosevelt Island that stand to benefit from cheaper heating and cooling, cleaner air and a smaller carbon footprint.  The adoption may be challenging, but the reward will be well worth the heat.\n",

      "﻿How Geothermal Energy Works\n",
      "Heat from the earth can be used as an energy source in many ways, from large and complex power stations to small and relatively simple pumping systems. This heat energy, known as geothermal energy, can be found almost anywhere—as far away as remote deep wells in Indonesia and as close as the dirt in our backyards.\n",
      "Many regions of the world are already tapping geothermal energy as an affordable and sustainable solution to reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and the global warming and public health risks that result from their use. For example, as of 2013 more than 11,700 megawatts (MW) of large, utility-scale geothermal capacity was in operation globally, with another 11,700 MW in planned capacity additions on the way [1]. These geothermal facilities produced approximately 68 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, enough to meet the annual needs of more than 6 million typical U.S. households. Geothermal plants account for more than 25 percent of the electricity produced in both Iceland and El Salvador [2].\n",
      "With more than 3,300 megawatts in eight states, the United States is a global leader in installed geothermal capacity. Eighty percent of this capacity is located in California, where more than 40 geothermal plants provide nearly 7 percent of the state’s electricity [3]. In thousands of homes and buildings across the United States, geothermal heat pumps also use the steady temperatures just underground to heat and cool buildings, cleanly and inexpensively.\n",
      "The geothermal resource\n",
      "Below Earth's crust, there is a layer of hot and molten rock, called magma. Heat is continually produced in this layer, mostly from the decay of naturally radioactive materials such as uranium and potassium. The amount of heat within 10,000 meters (about 33,000 feet) of Earth's surface contains 50,000 times more energy than all the oil and natural gas resources in the world.\n",
      "The areas with the highest underground temperatures are in regions with active or geologically young volcanoes. These \"hot spots\" occur at tectonic plate boundaries or at places where the crust is thin enough to let the heat through. The Pacific Rim, often called the Ring of Fire for its many volcanoes, has many hot spots, including some in Alaska, California, and Oregon. Nevada has hundreds of hot spots, covering much of the northern part of the state.\n",
      "These regions are also seismically active. Earthquakes and magma movement break up the rock covering, allowing water to circulate. As the water rises to the surface, natural hot springs and geysers occur, such as Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park. The water in these systems can be more than 200°C (430°F).\n",
      "Seismically active hotspots are not the only places where geothermal energy can be found. There is a steady supply of milder heat—useful for direct heating purposes—at depths of anywhere from 10 to a few hundred feet below the surface virtually in any location on Earth. Even the ground below your own backyard or local school has enough heat to control the climate in your home or other buildings in the community. In addition, there is a vast amount of heat energy available from dry rock formations very deep below the surface (4–10 km). Using the emerging technology known as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), we may be able to capture this heat for electricity production on a much larger scale than conventional technologies currently allow. While still primarily in the development phase, the first demonstration EGS projects provided electricity to grids in the United States and Australia in 2013.\n",
      "If the full economic potential of geothermal resources can be realized, they would represent an enormous source of electricity production capacity. In 2012, the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that conventional geothermal sources (hydrothermal) in 13 states have a potential capacity of 38,000 MW, which could produce 308 million MWh of electricity annually [4].\n",
      "State and federal policies are likely to spur developers to tap some of this potential in the next few years. The Geothermal Energy Association estimates that 125 projects now under development around the country could provide up to 2,500 megawatts of new capacity [3].\n",
      "As EGS technologies improve and become competitive, even more of the largely untapped geothermal resource could be developed. The NREL study found that hot dry rock resources could provide another 4 million MW of capacity, which is equivalent to more than all of today’s U.S. electricity needs [4].\n",
      "Not only do geothermal resources in the United States offer great potential, they can also provide continuous baseload electricity. According to NREL, the capacity factors of geothermal plants—a measure of the ratio of the actual electricity generated over time compared to what would be produced if the plant was running nonstop for that period—are comparable with those of coal and nuclear power [5]. With the combination of both the size of the resource base and its consistency, geothermal can play an indispensable role in a cleaner, more sustainable power system.\n",
      "How geothermal energy is captured\n",
      "Geothermal springs for power plants. Currently, the most common way of capturing the energy from geothermal sources is to tap into naturally occurring \"hydrothermal convection\" systems, where cooler water seeps into Earth's crust, is heated up, and then rises to the surface. Once this heated water is forced to the surface, it is a relatively simple matter to capture that steam and use it to drive electric generators. Geothermal power plants drill their own holes into the rock to more effectively capture the steam.\n",
      "There are three basic designs for geothermal power plants, all of which pull hot water and steam from the ground, use it, and then return it as warm water to prolong the life of the heat source. In the simplest design, known as dry steam, the steam goes directly through the turbine, then into a condenser where the steam is condensed into water. In a second approach, very hot water is depressurized or \"flashed\" into steam which can then be used to drive the turbine.\n",
      "In the third approach, called a binary cycle system, the hot water is passed through a heat exchanger, where it heats a second liquid—such as isobutane—in a closed loop. Isobutane boils at a lower temperature than water, so it is more easily converted into steam to run the turbine. These three systems are shown in the diagrams below.\n",
      "The choice of which design to use is determined by the resource. If the water comes out of the well as steam, it can be used directly, as in the first design. If it is hot water of a high enough temperature, a flash system can be used; otherwise it must go through a heat exchanger. Since there are more hot water resources than pure steam or high-temperature water sources, there is more growth potential in the binary cycle, heat exchanger design.\n",
      "The largest geothermal system now in operation is a steam-driven plant in an area called the Geysers, north of San Francisco, California. Despite the name, there are actually no geysers there, and the heat that is used for energy is all steam, not hot water. Although the area was known for its hot springs as far back as the mid-1800s, the first well for power production was not drilled until 1924. Deeper wells were drilled in the 1950s, but real development didn't occur until the 1970s and 1980s. By 1990, 26 power plants had been built, for a capacity of more than 2,000 MW.\n",
      "Because of the rapid development of the area in the 1980s, and the technology used, the steam resource has been declining since 1988. Today, owned primarily by the California utility Calpine and with a net operating capacity of 725 MW, the Geysers facilities still meets nearly 60 percent of the average electrical demand for California's North Coast region (from the Golden Gate Bridge north to the Oregon border) [6]. The plants at the Geysers use an evaporative water-cooling process to create a vacuum that pulls the steam through the turbine, producing power more efficiently. But this process loses 60 to 80 percent of the steam to the air, without re-injecting it underground. While the steam pressure may be declining, the rocks underground are still hot. To remedy the situation, various stakeholders partnered to create the Santa Rosa Geysers Recharge Project, which involves transporting 11 million gallons per day of treated wastewater from neighboring communities through a 40-mile pipeline and injecting it into the ground to provide more steam. The project came online in 2003, and in 2008 provided enough additional electricity for approximately 100,000 homes [7].   \n",
      "One concern with open systems like the Geysers is that they emit some air pollutants. Hydrogen sulfide—a toxic gas with a highly recognizable \"rotten egg\" odor—along with trace amounts of arsenic and minerals, is released in the steam. Salt can also pose an environmental problem. At a power plant located at the Salton Sea reservoir in Southern California, a significant amount of salt builds up in the pipes and must be removed. While the plant initially put the salts into a landfill, they now re-inject the salt back into a different well. With closed-loop systems, such as the binary cycle system, there are no emissions and everything brought to the surface is returned underground.\n",
      "Direct use of geothermal heat. Geothermal springs can also be used directly for heating purposes. Geothermal hot water is used to heat buildings, raise plants in greenhouses, dry out fish and crops, de-ice roads, improve oil recovery, aid in industrial processes like pasteurizing milk, and heat spas and water at fish farms. In Klamath Falls, Oregon, and Boise, Idaho, geothermal water has been used to heat homes and buildings for more than a century. On the east coast, the town of Warm Springs, Virginia obtains heat directly from spring water as well, using springs to heat one of the local resorts [8].\n",
      "In Iceland, virtually every building in the country is heated with hot spring water. In fact, Iceland gets more than 50 percent of its primary energy from geothermal sources [9]. In Reykjavik, for example (population 118,000), hot water is piped in from 25 kilometers away, and residents use it for heating and for hot tap water.\n",
      "Ground-source heat pumps. A much more conventional way to tap geothermal energy is by using geothermal heat pumps to provide heat and cooling to buildings. Also called ground-source heat pumps, they take advantage of the constant year-round temperature of about 50°F that is just a few feet below the ground’s surface. Either air or antifreeze liquid is pumped through pipes that are buried underground, and re-circulated into the building. In the summer, the liquid moves heat from the building into the ground. In the winter, it does the opposite, providing pre-warmed air and water to the heating system of the building.\n",
      "In the simplest use of ground-source heating and cooling, a tube runs from the outside air, under the ground, and into a building's ventilation system. More complicated, but more effective, systems use compressors and pumps—as in electric air conditioning systems—to maximize the heat transfer.\n",
      "In regions with temperature extremes, such as the northern United States in the winter and the southern United States in the summer, ground-source heat pumps are the most energy-efficient and environmentally clean heating and cooling systems available. Far more efficient than electric heating and cooling, these systems can circulate as much as 3 to 5 times the energy they use in the process. The U.S. Department of Energy found that heat pumps can save a typical home hundreds of dollars in energy costs each year, with the system typically paying for itself in 8 to 12 years. Tax credits and other incentives can reduce the payback period to 5 years or less [10].                                            \n",
      "More than 600,000 ground-source heat pumps supply climate control in U.S. homes and other buildings, with new installations occurring at a rate of about 60,000 per year [12]. While this is significant, it is still only a small fraction of the U.S. heating and cooling market, and several barriers to greater penetration into the market remain. For example, despite their long-term savings, geothermal heat pumps have higher up-front costs. In addition, installing them in existing homes and businesses can be difficult, since it involves digging up areas around a building’s structure. Finally, many heating and cooling installers are simply not familiar with the technology.\n",
      "However, ground-source heat pumps are catching on in some areas. In rural areas without access to natural gas pipelines, homes must use propane or electricity for heating and cooling. Heat pumps are much less expensive to operate than these conventional systems, and since buildings are generally widely spread out, installing underground loops is often not an issue. Underground loops can be easily installed during construction of new buildings as well, resulting in savings for the life of the building. Furthermore, recent policy developments are offering strong incentives for homeowners to install these systems.  The 2008 economic stimulus bill, Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, included an eight-year extension (through 2016) of the 30 percent investment tax credit, with no upper limit, to all home installations of EnergyStar certified geothermal heat pumps [11].  \n",
      "The future of geothermal energy\n",
      "Geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in moving the United States (and other regions of the world) toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy system. It is one of the few renewable energy technologies that can supply continuous, baseload power. Additionally, unlike coal and nuclear plants, binary geothermal plants can be used a flexible source of energy to balance the variable supply of renewable resources such as wind and solar. Binary plants have the capability to ramp production up and down multiple times each day, from 100 percent of nominal power down to a minimum of 10 percent [1].\n",
      "The costs for electricity from geothermal facilities are also becoming increasingly competitive. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for new geothermal plants (coming online in 2019) will be less than 5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), as opposed to more than 6 cents for new natural gas plants and more than 9 cents for new conventional coal [12]. There is also a bright future for the direct use of geothermal resources as a heating source for homes and businesses in any location.\n",
      "However, in order to tap into the full potential of geothermal energy, two emerging technologies require further development: Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and co-production of geothermal electricity in oil and gas wells.\n",
      "Enhanced geothermal systems. Geothermal heat occurs everywhere under the surface of the earth, but the conditions that make water circulate to the surface are found in less than 10 percent of Earth's land area. An approach to capturing the heat in dry areas is known as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) or \"hot dry rock\". The hot rock reservoirs, typically at greater depths below the surface than conventional sources, are first broken up by pumping high-pressure water through them. The plants then pump more water through the broken hot rocks, where it heats up, returns to the surface as steam, and powers turbines to generate electricity. The water is then returned to the reservoir through injection wells to complete the circulation loop. Plants that use a closed-loop binary cycle release no fluids or heat-trapping emissions other than water vapor, which may be used for cooling [13].  \n",
      "A 2006 study by MIT found that EGS technology could provide 100 gigawatts of electricity by 2050 [14]. The Department of Energy, several universities, the geothermal industry, and venture capital firms (including Google) are collaborating on research and demonstration projects to harness the potential of EGS. The Newberry Geothermal Project in Bend, Oregon has recently made significant progress in reducing EGS project costs and eliminating risks to future development [15]. The DOE hopes to have EGS ready for commercial development by 2015. Australia, France, Germany, and Japan also have R&D programs to make EGS commercially viable.\n",
      "One cause for careful consideration with EGS is the possibility of induced seismic activity that might occur from hot dry rock drilling and development. This risk is similar to that associated with hydraulic fracturing, an increasingly used method of oil and gas drilling, and with carbon dioxide capture and storage in deep saline aquifers. Though a potentially serious concern, the risk of an induced EGS-related seismic event that can be felt by the surrounding population or that might cause significant damage currently appears very low when projects are located an appropriate distance away from major fault lines and properly monitored. Appropriate site selection, assessment and monitoring of rock fracturing and seismic activity during and after construction, and open, transparent communication with local communities are also critical.\n",
      "Low-temperature and co-production of geothermal electricity in oil and gas wells. Low-temperature geothermal energy is derived from geothermal fluid found in the ground at temperatures of 150ºC (300ºF) or less. These resources are typically utilized in direct-use applications, such as heating buildings, but can also be used to produce electricity through binary cycle geothermal processes. Oil and gas fields already under production represent a large potential source of this type of geothermal energy. In many existing oil and gas reservoirs, a significant amount of high-temperature water or suitable high-pressure conditions are present, which could allow for the co-production of geothermal electricity along with the extraction of oil and gas resources. In some cases, exploiting these geothermal resources could even enhance the extraction of the oil and gas.\n",
      "An MIT study estimated that the United States has the potential to develop 44,000 MWs of geothermal capacity by 2050 by coproducing geothermal electricity at oil and gas fields—primarily in the Southeast and southern Plains states. The study projected that such advanced geothermal systems could supply 10 percent of U.S. baseload electricity by 2050, given R&D and deployment over the next 10 years [17].\n",
      "According to DOE, an average of 25 billion barrels of hot water is produced in United States oil and gas wells each year. This water, which has historically been viewed as an inconvenience to well operators, could be harnessed to produce up to 3 gigawatts of clean, reliable baseload energy [16]. This energy could not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also increase profitability and extend the economic life of existing oil and gas field infrastructure. The DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office is working toward a goal of achieving widespread production of low-temperature geothermal power by 2020.\n",
      "These exciting new developments in geothermal will be supported by unprecedented levels of federal R&D funding. Under, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, $400 million of new funding was allocated to the DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Program. Of this $90 million went to fund seven demonstration projects to prove the feasibility of EGS technology. Another $50 million funded 17 demonstration projects for other new technologies, including co-production with oil and gas and low temperature geothermal. The remaining funds went towards exploration technologies, expanding the deployment of geothermal heat pumps, and other uses. These investments are already beginning to expand the horizons of geothermal energy production and will likely continue to produce significant net benefits in the future [17].\n",
