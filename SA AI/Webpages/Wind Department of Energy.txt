Wind – Department of Energy
The United States is home to one of the largest and fastest-growing wind markets in the world. To stay competitive in this sector, the Energy Department invests in wind research and development projects, both on land and offshore, to advance technology innovations, create job opportunities and boost economic growth.
Moving forward, the U.S. wind industry remains a critical part of the Energy Department’s all-of-the-above energy strategy to cut carbon pollution, diversify our energy economy and bring the next generation of American-made clean energy technologies to market.
