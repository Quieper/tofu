We have updated the map
    • Spaldington River Valley - refused at appeal
    • Some of the 50 single turbines added - 5 operational, 1 refused after appeal, 2 appeal pending
    • Now operational - Sixpennywood + Marr and Hampole just off map +Goole Fields 1   
The map was started 5 years ago - and the threat identified then has largely materialised. There is now a new threat of single turbines which can be up to 300 feet high. But wind farms and turbines are now being refused locally and these decisions are being upheld at appeal. Two wind farms at Spaldington were refused at appeal, as was a single turbine at Wistow Lordship. It takes a lot of effort but these results show that wind farm applications can be defeated by determined effort by village communities. The process is helped when appeals are called in by the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles.
Wind energy is ineffective energy - over 5000 turbines could not match the output from Drax. Pointless destruction of our countryside. More than 20 wind farms. Over 200 turbines.
Wind farms built and operational.  
Wind farm approved, not yet built
Plans submitted, but not yet decided.
Wind farms in the design stage - prior to a planning application.
Rejected by local planners. The developer can appeal and usually do so. These wind farms may still be approved.

Rejected at appeal.
Or application withdrawn.

Wind energy is expensive energy
The wind might be free but the electricity generated is anything but free. A system of financial incentives for the wind farm owners ensures generous profits for them, paid by us through increased prices for electricity.
The Key Issues pages explains the subsidy system and how the extra cost is hidden in your electricity bill.
Wind energy cannot be relied upon
No wind no power - too much wind and turbines are paid to switch off.  Use our meters above to see where our power is being generated and how wind power varies.
