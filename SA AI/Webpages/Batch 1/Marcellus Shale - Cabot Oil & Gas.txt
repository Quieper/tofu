Marcellus Shale
Since the inception of Cabot’s horizontal drilling program in 2008, the Company’s Marcellus Shale position in northeast Pennsylvania has developed into the cornerstone asset of its portfolio and has been the primary driver of record production and reserve growth during this period.
Cabot has approximately 174,000 net acres in the dry gas window of the Marcellus Shale, primarily in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania.  The company has drilled approximately 650 net horizontal wells in its 10 years of drilling in the basin and is planning 85 to 90 additional net horizontal wells in 2019.
Cabot’s Marcellus Shale properties accounted for 100% of the Company’s proved reserves and 99% of the Company’s total net production as of year-end 2018.
