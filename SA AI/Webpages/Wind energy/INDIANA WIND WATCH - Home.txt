Indiana Communities fighting Big Wind's Onslaught.
Welcome to Indiana Wind Watch
We are a self-funded grassroots organization of volunteers in Indiana concerned about the health, safety, and welfare of Hoosiers forced to live near industrial wind turbines. It is our mission to protect every Hoosier from the unfortunate fate of living near irresponsibly-sited industrial wind turbines.​
If you live in Indiana and are concerned about an industrial wind turbine project being planned for your community, please join us.

Current News
CLICK HERE TO VIEW OPPOSITION TO JASPER COUNTY, INDIANA INDUSTRIAL WIND PROJECTS
NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE:
At the Statehouse: An amendment was written into SB 535 which will grandfather in Henry and Montgomery county town safety ordinances adopted prior to January 2018. The ordinances will prevent wind turbines from being built within four miles of the town. There are 12 counties in Indiana with no zoning and no protection from wind turbines. Special thanks to all Indiana Wind Watch supporters who reached out to legislators on this issue!

​Cass County
5/7/19 - Cass County's ordinance changed slightly to setbacks to property lines. The Cass County Property Rights group will continue to advocate for stricter measures protecting residents from the encroachment of wind energy projects near their homes. In late 2018, Renewable Energy Systems withdrew from the Harvest Wind project and canceled their wind lease contracts in Cass, Miami and Fulton Counties!

Clinton County
Clinton County Commissioners enacted a moratorium on wind development. E.ON is interested in a project there but Commissioners seem to be holding the line on their moratorium.

Fulton County
1/19 - Surveyor Seth White (surveyor elect) and new County Council member Ryan Zimpleman both replace pro-wind officials! 
In Fulton County, a local citizens group opposing a proposed commercial wind farm chalked up another win. “Two of three Fulton County Commissioners, Bryan Lewis and Rick Ranstead, signed a pledge stating that as long as they hold public office they will not allow commercial wind turbines in the county. Commissioner Steve Metzger, who recused himself from voting on wind related issues due to perceived conflicts of interest, refused to sign, saying he wasn’t interested.”

​Henry County
Henry County citizens are fighting off three wind companies while election results seemed to be an unofficial referendum on wind development in the county, and the people voted for No Wind candidates! Their No Wind Henry County group put forth strong candidates for some key seats in their county and WON every election they had a candidate running!  Ed Tarantino won the Commissioner's race, Susan Huhn, Peg Stefandel and Kenon Gray won County Council seats. We need more citizens across the state who care about the wind issue to take this important step and run for office and local change. New County Council member Susan Huhn was elected president of the board.

Jasper County
On 5/6/19, Jasper County Commissioners voted to approve a stricter wind ordinance that affords more protection for their citizens. Setbacks have been changed to 1,760 feet from a property line and 2,400 feet from a property line. There is a no wind turbine zone north of 1200 S. (which is much of the county). Jasper County citizens are encouraged to remain vigilant.

Kosciusko County
On Oct. 16, 2018, Kosciusko County adopted the safest wind ordinance in the state! Kosciusko County Commissioners unanimously approved a new wind ordinance including 3,960 ft. setbacks to property lines, zero shadow flicker on non-participants, 32 dBA at property lines, pre and post construction well inspections, property value guarantees for everyone living within two miles of a turbine, property owners within five miles of the project must be notified by the wind company of the project prior to the company getting leases signed and industrial wind turbines are only permitted in heavy industrial zones - because they are not agricultural!
THIS ORDINANCE IS THE NEW SAFE MODEL WIND ORDINANCE FOR THE STATE OF INDIANA!
Here is a link to Kosciusko County's zoning ordinance. Wind energy begins on pg. 47. It is a protective wind ordinance. https://www.kcgov.com/egov/documents/1473175057_30906.pdf

Marshall County
Marshall County citizens achieved a ban on industrial wind turbines in 2013 and remain vigilant. Stan Klotz was elected County Commissioner, term beginning January 2019. He was instrumental in achieving a moratorium on wind development during Marshall County's wind fight. 

Miami County
11/18 - Renewable Energy Systems' MET towers came down in Miami County!
Miami County's new ordinance with 2,000 foot setbacks to property lines and roads took effect July 11, 2018. Congratulations, Miami County Property Rights group! 

Montgomery County - On April 6th, 2019, Montgomery County's No Wind group hosted a successful educational meeting for their community and informed 200+ guests, including county officials, about the detriments of two potential wind projects by Apex and Akuo planned for their area. Ted Hartke attended the meeting and shared his family's experience of living in the midst of an industrial wind plant and the eventual abandonment of their home. Then on Monday, April 8th, Commissioner Phil Bane announced his resignation as County Commission effective April 15th. Two potential candidates, both thought to be individuals who will protect their community from the encroachment of wind turbines, have contacted the Republican Caucus with their intentions to fill the open Commissioners' seat.

Posey County - 
Concerned Posey County citizens have formed a group called Posey County Citizens for Property Rights and are working hard to educate their neighbors about the detriments of E.ON's proposed industrial wind turbines in Posey County. They are joining with Gibson County friends and neighbors to challenge E.ON's project which is reportedly to span Posey, Gibson and part of Vanderburgh County in southern Indiana. This proves that no rural community is safe from industrial wind turbines. It was believed for many years that wind companies would not target southern Indiana due to the poor wind speeds, but we know that if wind companies can build wind turbines higher, they will put them almost anywhere that rural citizens won't fight back and defend their property rights.

Pulaski County - 
Pulaski County Commissioners and Plan Commission unanimously voted to ban industrial wind turbines in Pulaski County. Kudos to these responsible individuals for protecting the health, safety, welfare, and property value of their residents! The ban took effect on Oct. 1, 2018.
​
Tippecanoe County  -
Tippecanoe County Commissioners voted to ban industrial wind turbines in February! Their recommendations went to the Plan Commission, where ban language will be drafted and sent back to the Commissioners for final approval. Congratulations, Tippecanoe County residents!

Tipton County Council
The Auditor of Tipton County, Gregg Townsend, appears on a billboard in Montgomery County with a quote saying that Tipton County Supports Wind. 
At a Tipton Co. Council, Mr. Townsend was questioned on this public statement appearing on the billboard.  The message is being taken as a blanket statement representing the position of the entire County, which members of Council, Commissioner Mullins, and citizens of Tipton County find unacceptable. 
Meeting link appears here.  Go to the 1 hour 55 minute mark:
https://livestream.com/accounts/21146465/events/8114286
Mr. Townsend spoke openly FOR WIND at the Summer Study Hearing at the Statehouse.  He spoke as Tipton County AUDITOR, as an OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE of his county.  After the hearing, one bystander mentioned to Mr. Townsend that he failed to share with the Summer Study Members that Tipton County INCREASED their setbacks AFTER that first phase of turbines was erected.that Tipton County, by and large, does NOT support Wind or further development in the county.  Now, Mr. Townsend continues to tout support for Wind Energy, portraying that the entire County enthusiastically supports wind energy, and is encouraging other Indiana counties to do the same.
We say:  TAKE DOWN THE BILLBOARD, MR. TOWNSEND.
Renewable Energy System's meteorological towers in Miami County came down November, 2018! Fulton and Cass county MET towers have also been removed! Cass County Property Rights group celebrated their candidate for county commissioner, Ryan Browning and Cass County County Council candidate Dave Redweik's wins! They will be working to keep Cass County wind turbine free!
