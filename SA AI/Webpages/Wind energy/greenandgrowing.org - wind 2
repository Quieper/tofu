IEA Says Offshore Wind Farms Could Produce More Energy Than The World Currently Uses

If the world were to focus on building wind farms in all coastal waters that would support them, we could cleanly generate enough energy to dwarf all the energy we currently produce now on Earth, according to a new study by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Our planet faces a climate crisis driven by addiction to dirty energy sources. Rising global temperatures threaten to cross a red line that will result in uncontrolled climate events, including worse droughts, stronger and more destructive hurricanes, and a major extinction across the globe.

And because the fossil fuel industry has been working to hide and deny the science of climate change since the 1950s, we now only have a few years to do something to prevent it instead of the decades we should have had. In the quest to replace fossil fuels permanently, the world should immediately get to work building wind turbines, especially offshore wind turbines that have the potential to generate more electricity than we currently already use worldwide.

According to the IEA report:

    The IEA finds that global offshore wind capacity may increase 15-fold and attract around $1 trillion of cumulative investment by 2040. This is driven by falling costs, supportive government policies and some remarkable technological progress, such as larger turbines and floating foundations. That’s just the start—the IEA report finds that offshore wind technology has the potential to grow far more strongly with stepped-up support from policy makers.

The problem is that the current output from offshore wind turbines is minuscule at the moment.

“Offshore wind currently provides just 0.3% of global power generation, but its potential is vast,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol told The Guardian.

Indeed, the potential is so vast that The Guardian estimated that building them in all useable sites would be a big deal.

“If wind farms were built across all useable sites which are no further than 60km (37 miles) off the coast, and where coastal waters are no deeper than 60 meters, they could generate 36,000 terawatt-hours of renewable electricity a year,” the publication noted. “This would easily meet the current global demand for electricity of 23,000 terawatt hours.”

Yes, it certainly would, and Birol says that major firms would crazy to stick with fossil fuels when there is much more profit to be had from energy production at offshore windfarms. This includes the fossil fuel industry itself.

“Offshore wind provides a huge new business portfolio for major engineering firms and established oil and gas companies which have a strong offshore production experience,” Birol said. “Our analysis shows that 40% of the work in offshore wind construction and maintenance has synergies with oil and gas practices.”

That also means workers in the oil and gas field can easily transition into the green jobs of the future, thus debunking a key claim of the fossil fuel industry that clean energy will kill jobs.

Environmentalist Bill McKibben enthusiastically endorsed the idea.

“Wind turbines in the shallow parts of the planet’s oceans can provide more electricity than the planet uses,” McKibben wrote. “So let’s get going!”

Wind energy is already doubling production in nations such as Scotland, which saw production double despite complaining from the sitting United States president that the turbines are somehow ruining the ocean view.

But without this absolutely necessary switch to wind energy, our coastlines are going to drastically change, and not for the better, as rising sea levels flood thousands of miles of coast around the world. It would be much better to have wind turbines in the viewing area than to watch our coastlines disappear entirely because we did nothing when we had the chance. Wind power gives us the chance to move away from fossil fuels. And wind can clearly take care of our energy needs alone. Now just imagine if we did this and combined it with other forms of renewable energy. We would never have to worry about energy again, and our planet would be healthier, too. It’s a win-win.
