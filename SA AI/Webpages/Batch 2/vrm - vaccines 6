Another season of fear-mongering headlines & Government Health Department-spun pronouncements is upon us; our communities faced with a seemingly imminent (manufactured) health crisis being foisted down our collective throats. 

So what, exactly, are we dealing with here?  VRM: Ebola Report

“As the (Ebola) epidemic gets more and more formidable and in some cases out of control it is quite conceivable, if not likely, that we may need to deploy the vaccine to the entire country to be able to shut the epidemic down. That is clearly a possibility.” U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (October 06, 2014)

The benchmark of sound journalism & good detective work in this field depends the weight of scientific evidence presented, the accuracy of the data, and the ability to distinguish verifiable truth from (Pharmaceutical & Vaccine Industry) promulgated lies & misinformation – something clearly out of step with the Mainstream Media protocols of cover-up & deception.  
We’ve been here before. History is predictably repeating itself…again.
