Vaccine Side Effects

Most people don’t have any serious side effects from vaccines. The most common side effects — like soreness where the shot was given — are usually mild and go away quickly on their own.
What are common side effects of vaccines?

The most common side effects after vaccination are mild. They include:

    Pain, swelling, or redness where the shot was given
    Mild fever
    Chills
    Feeling tired
    Headache
    Muscle and joint aches

Most common side effects are a sign that your body is starting to build immunity (protection) against a disease. Learn more about how vaccines provide immunity.
What about serious side effects?

Serious side effects from vaccines are extremely rare. For example, if 1 million doses of a vaccine are given, 1 to 2 people may have a severe allergic reaction.

Keep in mind that getting vaccinated is much safer than getting the diseases vaccines prevent. Learn more about vaccine safety.
What if I feel sick after getting vaccinated?

Talk with your doctor if you’re concerned about your health after getting vaccinated. You or your doctor can choose to report the side effect to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

In the very rare event that a vaccine causes a serious problem, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) may offer financial help to individuals who file a petition. Learn more about VICP.

    Do childhood vaccines cause autism?
