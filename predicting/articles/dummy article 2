Negative Aspects
Storage Units
When using solar energy, you have to store the heat energy in water, this can cause health problems. Some of the health risks can occur when mold or fungi form and the containers are ideal for this purpose. Due to these reasons, solar energy is not always safe.
Solar Panels
The actual solar panel is made out of some harmful materials, such as silicon. If you breathe in any silicon dust, if is very bad for you and cause you to have scars on your lung tissues and interfere with your breathing, this disease is called silicosis. Long time exposure to silicon can actually cause you to die. In India, a study was conducted about silicon and it was found out that 25 people actually died. 
Photovoltaic Cells
These cells convert sunlight into electricity. These substances are harmless, but they can cause health problems if not handled or stored carefully.
Cost and Efficiency
It's quite expensive to get solar panels installed for your house, the actually panels are also very expensive. People need energy through the day and night, and solar energy can only be absorbed during the day.
